With over 742,000 students enrolled and over one hundred and seventy four thousand reviews (<strong>with</strong> <strong>tens of thousands of those 5-star)</strong> to date, these comprehensive java tutorials cover everything you’ll ever need. </p><p>Whether you want to:</p><p>- build the skills you need to get your first&nbsp;Java programming job</p><p>- move to a more senior software developer position</p><p>- pass the oracle java certification exam</p><p>- or just learn java to be able to create your own java apps (desktop or web based) quickly.<br></p><p>...this complete Java Masterclass is the course you need to do all of this, <em>and more.</em> </p><p><strong>Why would you choose to learn Java?</strong></p><p>The reality is that there is a lot of computer languages out there.&nbsp; It's in the hundreds.&nbsp; Why would you choose the Java language?</p><p>The number one reason is its popularity.&nbsp; According to many official websites that track the popularity of languages, Java is&nbsp; in the top 3 most popular languages worldwide in 2022. &nbsp; Popularity means more companies and their staff are using it, so there are more career opportunities available for you if you are skilled in the language.</p><p>The last thing you want to do is pick a language that is not in mainstream use. &nbsp;Java came out in the 1990s and is still very popular today and continually updated by the owners, Oracle, over 30 years later.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Are you aiming to get your first Java Programming job but struggling to find out what skills employers want</strong> and which course will give you those skills?<br><br>This course is designed to give you the Java skills you need to get a job as a Java developer.&nbsp; By the end of the course, you will understand Java extremely well and be able to build your own Java apps and be productive as a software developer. <br><br>Lots of students have been successful in getting their first job or promotion after going through the course.<br><br>Here is just one example of a student who lost her job and despite having never coded in her life previously, got a full-time software developer position in just a few months after starting this course.&nbsp; She didn't even complete the course!</p><p><br><strong>""</strong>Three months ago I lost my job, came to a turning point in my life, and finally made the drastic decision to completely change course.&nbsp; &nbsp;I decided to switch career paths and go into coding. My husband found and gave me your Complete Java Masterclass at Udemy as a gift, and I wholeheartedly dove into it as a lifeline. Following your course has been absolutely enjoyable (still working on it, not yet finished), and has been a great way of keeping on course, dedicated and motivated.&nbsp; Yesterday, three months after starting the course, and honestly to my surprise, I received (and accepted!) a job offer as a full-time developer. I wanted to just drop you a line to say thank you for doing this work, for being such a dedicated teacher, and for putting all this knowledge available out there in such an approachable way. It has, literally, been life-changing. <strong> With gratitude,&nbsp; Laura""</strong></p><p><br>The course is a whopping 100 hours long.&nbsp; <strong>Perhaps you have looked at the size of the course and are feeling a little overwhelmed at the prospect of finding time to complete it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe you are wondering if you need to go through it all?</strong></p><p>Firstly, Laura's story above shows that you do not have to complete the entire course - she was yet to complete the course when she accepted her developer job offer.</p><p>Secondly, the course is designed as a one-stop shop for Java.</p><p>The core java material you need to learn java development is covered in the first seven sections (around 14 hours in total).&nbsp; The&nbsp;Java Basics are covered in those sections. The rest of the course covers intermediate, advanced, and optional material you do not technically need to go through.<br><br>For example section 13 is a whopping 10 hours just by itself and is aimed at those students who want to build desktop applications with graphical user interfaces.&nbsp; JavaFX&nbsp;(which is the technology used in this section) is something that most java developers will rarely or never need to work on.&nbsp; So you could skip that section entirely.&nbsp; But if you are one of the few that need to build user interfaces, then the content is there and ready for you.&nbsp; &nbsp;And there are other sections you can completely avoid if you wish.</p><p>If you want to know absolutely everything about Java, then you can go through the entire course if you wish, but it's not necessary to do so if you are just looking to learn the essential information to get a java developer position.</p><p><strong>What version of Java should you learn?<br><br></strong>Generally speaking, you would want to learn the very latest version of a computer programming language, but <strong>that's not the case</strong> <strong>with Java.</strong></p><p>Oracle, the owner of Java release many versions of Java.&nbsp; Some are released and expire in six months, with no future updates or support. &nbsp;Other versions have long-term support, for many years.</p><p>You can probably see why learning a version of Java that has expired makes no sense, and is likely a waste of time.</p><p>A company using Java technology&nbsp;(big or small) is not going to use a version of Java that has no updates or support.&nbsp; They will stick to stable, well-supported versions of Java that get updates.</p><p>Right now, in December 2022, the version of Java that offers this long-term support&nbsp;(LTS) is Java 17 - It's being fully supported until at least 2029 and likely will be extended from there.</p><p>As such, you want to learn the version of Java that your future employer will use, and that's&nbsp;Java 17.</p><p>The course will also be updated in the future as new LTS versions are announced by Oracle.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>BOTTOM&nbsp;LINE:&nbsp;You will learn the RIGHT VERSION&nbsp;of JAVA in this course!&nbsp; Right meaning the right version to maximize your future Java potential with clients or Employers.</strong></p><p><br><strong>Will this course give me core java skills?</strong></p><p>Yes, it will.&nbsp; Core&nbsp;Java is the fundamental part of the Java JDK (the java development kit) that programmers need to learn to move onto other more advanced technologies.</p><p><strong>Why should you take this course?</strong><br><br>It's been a best-seller since its release on Udemy, you would be joining over 742,000 students who are already enrolled in the course.</p><p>There are well over 174,000 reviews left by students.&nbsp; It's rated as the best course to learn Java for beginners.<br><br><strong>What makes this course a bestseller? </strong></p><p>Like you, thousands of others were frustrated and fed up with fragmented Youtube tutorials or incomplete or outdated courses which assume you already know a bunch of stuff, as well as thick, college-like textbooks able to send even the most caffeine-fuelled coder to sleep. </p><p>Like you, they were tired of low-quality lessons, poorly explained topics, and confusing info presented in the wrong way. That’s why so many find success in this complete Java developer course. It’s designed with simplicity and seamless progression in mind through its content.<br><br>This course assumes <strong>no previous coding experience</strong> and takes you from absolute beginner core concepts, like showing you the free tools you need to download and install, to writing your very first Java program.&nbsp; You will learn the core java skills you need to become employable in around 14 hours, and if you choose to, can take advantage of all the additional content in the course. It's a one-stop shop to learn java. If you want to go beyond the core content you can do so at any time.</p><p><strong>Here’s just some of what you’ll learn</strong></p><p>(It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course)</p><ul><li><p>All the essential Java keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating</p></li><li><p>You will learn the answers to questions like What is a Java class, What is polymorphism and inheritance and to apply them to your java apps.</p></li><li><p>How to safely download and install all necessary coding tools with less time and no frustrating installations or setups</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many aspects of the Java API (the protocols and tools for building applications) so you can code for all platforms and derestrict your program’s user base (and potential sales)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>How to develop powerful Java applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier. &nbsp;<strong>IntelliJ</strong> has both a <strong>FREE</strong> and&nbsp;PAID version, and you can use either in this course.</p></li></ul><p>(Don’t worry if you’re used to using Eclipse, NetBeans, or some other IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course)</p><ul><li><p>Learn Java to a sufficient level to be a be to transition to core Java technologies like Android development, the Spring framework, Java EE&nbsp;(Enterprise edition) in general as well as and other technologies. In order to progress to these technologies, you need to first learn core Java - the fundamental building blocks.&nbsp; That's what this course will help you to achieve.</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>“AP-what?”</em></strong></p><p>Don't worry if none of that made sense. I go into great detail explaining each and every core concept, programming term, and buzzwords you need to create your own Java programs.</p><p>This truly is Java for complete beginners. </p><p>By the end of this comprehensive course, you’ll master Java programming no matter what level of experience you’re at right now. You’ll understand what you are doing, and why you are doing it. This isn’t a recipe book, you’ll use your own creativity to make unique, intuitive programs. </p><p>Not only do these HD videos show you how to become a programmer in great detail, but this course includes a unique <strong>challenge feature</strong>. Each time a core concept is taught, a video presents a challenge for you to help you understand what you have just learned in a <em>real-world scenario.</em></p><p>You’ll go and complete the challenge on your own, then come back and see the answers which I then explain in detail in a video, allowing you to check your results and identify any areas you need to go back and work on.</p><p>This is a proven way to help you <em>understand</em> Java faster and ensure you reach your goal of becoming a Java Developer in record time. Remember doing those old past exam papers in high school or college? It’s the same concept, and it works. </p><p>As your instructor, I have close to&nbsp; <strong>40 years of experience</strong> as a software developer and teacher and have been using Java since the year 2000. Yes, over 22 years <em>(I’ve taught students younger than that)</em>. Meaning not only can I teach this content with great simplicity, but I can make it fun too!</p><p>It’s no surprise my previous students have amazing results...</p><p><strong>See what your fellow students have to say:</strong></p><p>""This course was a guiding light in my ""Becoming a developer"" path from the first step. It helped me become a much more educated developer comparing to my friend who learned to code from trial/error. It's still a guide for me. every now and then I will come back to this course to learn something new or to improve what I've learned somewhere else. A BIG Thanks to ""Tim Buchalka"" my Master."" - Sina Jz<br><br>""I was an absolute beginner when I started this course, and now I can write some good small advanced clean codes. I wrote a code and showed it to a programmer, and he was shocked, he told me that I'm more than ready to start a programming career."" - Amirreza Moeini<br><br>""I am taking this class in conjunction with a Java 101 college class. I have learned more in one afternoon of videos from this class than I have in 4 weeks of a college class. Tim actually explains what things are and why they do what they do, as opposed to my college instructor that mainly said ""go make a program that does *whatever*"" and then I had to figure out a program that would meet those requirements but not actually learning why it worked."" - Stacy Harris<br></p><p>It’s safe to say my students are thrilled with this course, and more importantly, their results, <em>and you can be too</em>…</p><p>This complete Java course will teach you everything you need to know in order to code awesome, profitable projects, <br><br><strong>Is the course updated?</strong></p><p>As mentioned above, yes.</p><p>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released <em>every day</em>, meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.<br><br>A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated.&nbsp; Learning an older version of Java can be counterproductive - you could be learning the ""old way"" of doing things, rather than using current technology.<br><br>Make sure you check the last updated date on the page of any course you plan to buy - you will be shocked to see some have not been updated for years.&nbsp; <br><br>That’s why I’m always adding new, up-to-date content to this course at <strong>no extra charge</strong>. Buy this course once, and you’ll have lifetime access to it and any future updates (which are on the way as we speak). <br><br>And when I say updated, I also mean enhanced.&nbsp; With the recently released Java 17 update, a lot of the content has changed to actually include features included in Java 17.&nbsp; This is not just a ""rebadged"" update - the content is updated with new features of Java.&nbsp; Videos are actually re-recorded, etc.<br><br>With this complete Java Masterclass, you will always have updated, relevant content.</p><p><strong><em>What if I have questions?</em></strong></p><p>As if this course wasn’t complete enough, I offer <strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions you have <strong>7 days a week</strong> (whereas many instructors answer just once per week, <em>or not at all</em>). </p><p>This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With my hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks. </p><p><em>Student Quote: “</em>This course is a great place to ask questions if you have them or find help if you become stuck in areas.<em>” - Blake S.</em></p><p><strong><em>There’s no risk either!</em></strong></p><p>This course comes with a <strong>full 30-day money-back guarantee</strong>. Meaning if you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, simply let me know and I’ll refund you 100%, every last penny no questions asked.</p><p>You either end up with Java skills, go on to develop great programs and potentially make an awesome career for yourself, or you try the course and simply get all your money back if you don’t like it… </p><p><strong>You literally can’t lose.</strong> </p><p><strong>Ready to get started, developer?</strong></p><p><strong>Enroll now </strong>using the “Add to Cart” button on the right, and get started on your way to creative, advanced Java brilliance.

This course assumes&nbsp;you have <strong>NO&nbsp;prior knowledge</strong> and by the end of it you'll be able to&nbsp;<strong>hack systems like black-hat hackers</strong> and <strong>secure them like security experts!</strong></p><p>This&nbsp;course is&nbsp;highly <strong>practical</strong> but it won't neglect the theory; we'll start with ethical hacking basics, breakdown the different penetration testing fields and install the needed software (on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X), then we'll dive and start hacking straight away. You'll <strong>learn everything by example</strong>, by analysing and exploiting different systems such as networks, servers, clients, websites .....etc. We'll never have any boring dry theoretical lectures.</p><p>The course is divided into a number of sections, each section covers a penetration testing / hacking field, in each of these sections you'll first learn how the target system works, the weaknesses of this system, and how to <strong>practically</strong> exploit theses weaknesses to hack this system.</p><p>By the end of the course you will have a strong foundation in most hacking or penetration testing fields and you'll also learn how to <strong>detect, prevent and secure</strong> systems and yourself from&nbsp;the discussed attacks.&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>The course is divided into four main sections:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;Network Hacking</strong><em> -&nbsp;</em>This section will teach you how to test the security of both wired &amp; wireless networks. First, you will learn network basics, how they work, and how devices communicate with each other. Then it will branch into three sub sections:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Pre-connection<strong> </strong>attacks:<em>&nbsp;</em>in this subsection you'll learn a number of attacks that can be executed without connecting to the target network and without the need to know the network password; you'll learn how to&nbsp;<strong>gather&nbsp;information</strong>&nbsp;about the networks around you, discover connected devices, and control connections (<strong>deny/allow devices from connecting to networks</strong>). </p></li><li><p>Gaining Access: Now that you gathered information about&nbsp;the networks around you, in this subsection you will learn how to <strong>crack</strong> the key and get the password to your target network whether it uses<strong> WEP, WPA </strong>or even<strong> WPA2</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Post Connection attacks: Now that you have the key, you can connect to the target network, in this subsection you will learn a number of<strong>&nbsp;powerful techniques</strong>&nbsp;that allow you to gather comprehensive information about the connected devices, <strong>see anything they do on the internet</strong> (such as login information, <strong>passwords</strong>, visited urls, images, videos ....etc), redirect requests, <strong>inject evil code</strong> in loaded pages and much more! All of these attacks work against both wireless and wired networks. You will also learn how to&nbsp;<strong>create a fake WiFi network,</strong>&nbsp;attract users to connect to it and use all of the above techniques against the connected clients.</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>2.&nbsp;Gaining Access</strong><em> -&nbsp;</em>In this section you will learn two main approaches to&nbsp;<strong>gain full control or hack&nbsp;computer systems</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Server Side Attacks<em>: &nbsp;</em>In this subsection you will learn how to&nbsp;<strong>gain full access</strong>&nbsp;to computer systems&nbsp;<strong>without user interaction</strong>. You will learn how to gather useful information about a target computer system such as its&nbsp;operating system,&nbsp;open ports, installed services, then use this information to&nbsp;<strong>discover weaknesses and vulnerabilities</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>exploit</strong>&nbsp;them to gain full control over the target. Finally you will&nbsp;learn how to automatically scan servers for vulnerabilities and generate different types of&nbsp;<strong>reports</strong>&nbsp;with your discoveries.</p></li><li><p>Client Side Attacks<em> -&nbsp;</em>If the target system does not contain any weaknesses then the only way to hack it is by interacting with the users, in this subsection you'll learn how to get the target user to install a backdoor on their system without even realising, this is done by&nbsp;<strong>hijacking software updates</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>backdooring downloads </strong>on the fly. This subsection also teaches you how to use social engineering to hack secure systems, so you'll learn how to gather comprehensive information about system users such as their social accounts, friends, their mails.....etc, you'll learn how to <strong>create trojans</strong> by backdooring normal files (such as an image or a pdf) and use the gathered information to spoof emails so they appear as if they're sent from the target's friend, boss or any email account they're likely to interact with, to social engineer them into running your trojan.</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>3.&nbsp;Post Exploitation</strong><em> -&nbsp;</em>In this section you will learn how to interact with the systems you compromised so far. You’ll&nbsp;learn how to<strong> access the file system </strong>(read/write/upload/execute),&nbsp;<strong>maintain your access</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>spy</strong>&nbsp;on the target (capture key strikes, turn on the webcam, take screenshots....etc) and even&nbsp;use the target computer as a <strong>pivot </strong>to hack other systems.<br></p><p><strong>4.&nbsp;Website / Web Application Hacking</strong><em> -&nbsp;</em>In this section you will learn&nbsp;<strong>how websites work</strong>, how to&nbsp;<strong>gather information</strong>&nbsp;about a target website (such as website owner, server location, used technologies ....etc) and how to&nbsp;<strong>discover </strong>and<strong> exploit </strong>the following dangerous <strong>vulnerabilities</strong> to hack websites:</p><ul><li><p>File Upload.</p></li><li><p>Code Execution.</p></li><li><p>Local File Inclusion.</p></li><li><p>Remote File Inclusion.</p></li><li><p>SQL Injection.</p></li><li><p>Cross Site Scripting (XSS).</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>At the end of each section you will&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;<strong>detect, prevent and secure</strong> systems and yourself from&nbsp;the discussed attacks.&nbsp; </p><p> </p><p>All the techniques in this course are&nbsp;<strong>practical</strong> and work against real systems, you'll understand the whole mechanism of each technique first, then you'll learn how to use it to hack the target system. By the end of the course you'll be able to modify these techniques to launch more powerful attacks, and adopt them to suit different situations and different scenarios.</p><p>With this course you'll get <strong>24/7 support</strong>, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&amp;A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><em>Notes: </em></p><ul><li><p><em>This course is created for educational purposes only,&nbsp;all the attacks are launched in my own lab or against systems that I have permission to test.</em></p></li><li><p><em>This course is totally a product of Zaid Sabih &amp; zSecurity and no other organisation&nbsp;is associated with it or a certification exam.

1754098;The Data Science Course: Complete Data Science Bootcamp;https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/;53692;1;1;https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1754098_e0df_3.jpg;en_US;"<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p><p>Data scientist is one of the best suited professions to thrive this century. It is digital, programming-oriented, and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>However, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And how can you do that? &nbsp; </p><p>Universities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming)&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Most online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture &nbsp; </p><p><strong>The Solution</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Data science is a multidisciplinary field. It encompasses a wide range of topics.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>Understanding of the data science field and the type of analysis carried out &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Mathematics &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Statistics&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Python&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Applying advanced statistical techniques in Python&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Data Visualization &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Machine Learning &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Deep Learning &nbsp; </p></li></ul><p>Each of these topics builds on the previous ones. And you risk getting lost along the way if you don’t acquire these skills in the right order. For example, one would struggle in the application of Machine Learning techniques before understanding the underlying Mathematics. Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>So, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2023.</em></strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>We believe this is the first training program that solves the biggest challenge to entering the data science field <strong>– having all the necessary resources in one place.</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Moreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course teaches you everything you need to know to become a data scientist at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Skills</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp;Intro to Data and Data Science</strong></p><p>Big data, business intelligence, business analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We know these buzzwords belong to the field of data science but what do they all mean?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>
As a candidate data scientist, you must understand the ins and outs of each of these areas and recognise the appropriate approach to solving a problem. This ‘Intro to data and data science’ will give you a comprehensive look at all these buzzwords and where they fit in the realm of data science.
&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2. Mathematics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Learning the tools is the first step to doing data science. You must first see the big picture to then examine the parts in detail.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>We take a detailed look specifically at calculus and linear algebra as they are the subfields data science relies on.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Calculus and linear algebra are essential for programming in data science. If you want to understand advanced machine learning algorithms, then you need these skills in your arsenal.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3. Statistics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>You need to think like a scientist before you can become a scientist. Statistics trains your mind to frame problems as hypotheses and gives you techniques to test these hypotheses, just like a scientist. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>This course doesn’t just give you the tools you need but teaches you how to use them. Statistics trains you to think like a scientist.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4. Python</strong></p><p>Python is a relatively new programming language and, unlike R, it is a general-purpose programming language. You can do anything with it! Web applications, computer games and data science are among many of its capabilities. That’s why, in a short space of time, it has managed to disrupt many disciplines. Extremely powerful libraries have been developed to enable data manipulation, transformation, and visualisation. Where Python really shines however, is when it deals with machine and deep learning.</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models through powerful frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc, Python is a must have programming language. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5. Tableau</strong></p><p>Data scientists don’t just need to deal with data and solve data driven problems. They also need to convince company executives of the right decisions to make. These executives may not be well versed in data science, so the data scientist must but be able to present and visualise the data’s story in a way they will understand. That’s where Tableau comes in – and we will help you become an expert story teller using the leading visualisation software in business intelligence and data science.</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>A data scientist relies on business intelligence tools like Tableau to communicate complex results to non-technical decision makers. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>6. Advanced Statistics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Regressions, clustering, and factor analysis are all disciplines that were invented before machine learning. However, now these statistical methods are all performed through machine learning to provide predictions with unparalleled accuracy. This section will look at these techniques in detail. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Data science is all about predictive modelling and you can become an expert in these methods through this ‘advance statistics’ section. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>7. Machine Learning</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The final part of the program and what every section has been leading up to is deep learning. Being able to employ machine and deep learning in their work is what often separates a data <em>scientist </em>from a data <em>analyst. </em>This section covers all common machine learning techniques and deep learning methods with TensorFlow. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Machine learning is everywhere. Companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been using machines that can learn on their own for years. Now is the time for <em>you</em> to control the machines. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>***What you get***</strong></p><ul><li><p>A $1250 data science training program&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Active Q&amp;A support &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>All the knowledge to get hired as a data scientist &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>A community of data science learners &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>A certificate of completion&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Access to future updates &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Solve real-life business cases that will get you the job&nbsp; &nbsp; </p></li></ul><p><strong>You will become a data scientist from scratch</strong>

Web development is one of the <strong>most future-proof and highest-paying industries</strong> in the world. And HTML and CSS is the entry point to this world!</p><p>But you already know all this, that's why you want to learn HTML and CSS too. Well, you came to the right place!</p><p>This is the best and most complete course for starting your web development journey that you will find on Udemy. It's an <strong>all-in-one package</strong> that takes you from knowing nothing about HTML and CSS, to building beautiful websites using tools and technologies that professional web developers use every single day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[02] Why is this course so unique and popular?</strong></p><p><strong><em>Reason #1: The course is completely project-based</em></strong></p><p>Simple demos are boring, and therefore you're gonna learn everything by <strong>building actual projects</strong>! In the final project (<em>www.omnifood.dev</em>), together we hand-code a beautiful and responsive landing page for a <strong>fictional company</strong> that I made up just for the course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Reason #2: You will not just learn how to code</em></strong></p><p>Coding is great, but it's not everything! That's why we will go through the entire <strong>7-step process</strong> of building and launching our website project.</p><p>So the huge Omnifood project will teach you <strong>real-world skills to build real-world HTML and CSS websites</strong>: how to plan projects and page layouts, how to implement designs using HTML and CSS techniques, how to write clean and organized code, how to optimize websites for good speed performance, and many more.</p><p>On top of that, this course has a <strong>huge focus on beautiful design</strong>. In fact, this is the only course on the market that focuses on both coding and designing, together.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Reason #3: I'm the right teacher for you</em></strong></p><p>With the right guidance and a well-structured curriculum, building websites can be <strong>quite easy and fun to learn</strong>. With a bunch of random tutorials and YouTube videos? Not so much. And that's where I come in.</p><p>My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2015 to over 200,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.</p><p>Using that feedback, I recently rebuilt this course from scratch and <strong>designed the ideal course curriculum</strong> for every type of student. It's a <strong>unique blend</strong> of projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges. I'm sure you're gonna love it!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[03] Why is this course so long?</strong></p><p><strong>Reason #1:</strong> I take time to <strong>explain every single concept</strong> that I teach, so that you actually learn, and not just copy code from the screen (<strong>this is a course</strong>, not a tutorial)</p><p><strong>Reason #2:</strong> I go into topics that other HTML and CSS courses shy away from: professional web design, component and layout patterns, some CSS theory, website planning in theory and practice, and developer skills. I believe you need all of this to be successful!</p><p><strong>Reason #3:</strong> There is a lot of repetition, so that you actually <strong>assimilate and practice</strong> what you learn. Practice is the single most important ingredient to learning, and therefore I provide plenty of opportunities for you to sharpen your skills</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[04] Here is what's also included in the package:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Up-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy Business students)</p></li><li><p>Professional English captions (not the&nbsp;auto-generated ones)</p></li><li><p>Downloadable design assets + starter code and final code for each section</p></li><li><p>Downloadable slides for 20+ theory videos (not boring, I promise!)</p></li><li><p>Access to countless free design and development resources that I curated over many years</p></li><li><p>Free support in the course Q&amp;A</p></li><li><p>10+ coding challenges to practice your new skills (solutions included)</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>[05] This course is for you if...</strong></p><ul><li><p>... you are a complete beginner with no idea of how to build a website.</p></li><li><p>... you already know a bit of HTML and CSS from some tutorials or videos, but struggle to put together a good-looking, complete website.</p></li><li><p>... you are a designer and want to expand your skills into HTML and CSS, because all your designer friends are learning how to code (they are smart!).</p></li></ul><p>Basically, if you are an HTML and CSS master, and build the most beautiful websites in the world, then DON'T take the course.

With over 742,000 students enrolled and over one hundred and seventy four thousand reviews (<strong>with</strong> <strong>tens of thousands of those 5-star)</strong> to date, these comprehensive java tutorials cover everything you’ll ever need. </p><p>Whether you want to:</p><p>- build the skills you need to get your first&nbsp;Java programming job</p><p>- move to a more senior software developer position</p><p>- pass the oracle java certification exam</p><p>- or just learn java to be able to create your own java apps (desktop or web based) quickly.<br></p><p>...this complete Java Masterclass is the course you need to do all of this, <em>and more.</em> </p><p><strong>Why would you choose to learn Java?</strong></p><p>The reality is that there is a lot of computer languages out there.&nbsp; It's in the hundreds.&nbsp; Why would you choose the Java language?</p><p>The number one reason is its popularity.&nbsp; According to many official websites that track the popularity of languages, Java is&nbsp; in the top 3 most popular languages worldwide in 2022. &nbsp; Popularity means more companies and their staff are using it, so there are more career opportunities available for you if you are skilled in the language.</p><p>The last thing you want to do is pick a language that is not in mainstream use. &nbsp;Java came out in the 1990s and is still very popular today and continually updated by the owners, Oracle, over 30 years later.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Are you aiming to get your first Java Programming job but struggling to find out what skills employers want</strong> and which course will give you those skills?<br><br>This course is designed to give you the Java skills you need to get a job as a Java developer.&nbsp; By the end of the course, you will understand Java extremely well and be able to build your own Java apps and be productive as a software developer. <br><br>Lots of students have been successful in getting their first job or promotion after going through the course.<br><br>Here is just one example of a student who lost her job and despite having never coded in her life previously, got a full-time software developer position in just a few months after starting this course.&nbsp; She didn't even complete the course!</p><p><br><strong>""</strong>Three months ago I lost my job, came to a turning point in my life, and finally made the drastic decision to completely change course.&nbsp; &nbsp;I decided to switch career paths and go into coding. My husband found and gave me your Complete Java Masterclass at Udemy as a gift, and I wholeheartedly dove into it as a lifeline. Following your course has been absolutely enjoyable (still working on it, not yet finished), and has been a great way of keeping on course, dedicated and motivated.&nbsp; Yesterday, three months after starting the course, and honestly to my surprise, I received (and accepted!) a job offer as a full-time developer. I wanted to just drop you a line to say thank you for doing this work, for being such a dedicated teacher, and for putting all this knowledge available out there in such an approachable way. It has, literally, been life-changing. <strong> With gratitude,&nbsp; Laura""</strong></p><p><br>The course is a whopping 100 hours long.&nbsp; <strong>Perhaps you have looked at the size of the course and are feeling a little overwhelmed at the prospect of finding time to complete it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe you are wondering if you need to go through it all?</strong></p><p>Firstly, Laura's story above shows that you do not have to complete the entire course - she was yet to complete the course when she accepted her developer job offer.</p><p>Secondly, the course is designed as a one-stop shop for Java.</p><p>The core java material you need to learn java development is covered in the first seven sections (around 14 hours in total).&nbsp; The&nbsp;Java Basics are covered in those sections. The rest of the course covers intermediate, advanced, and optional material you do not technically need to go through.<br><br>For example section 13 is a whopping 10 hours just by itself and is aimed at those students who want to build desktop applications with graphical user interfaces.&nbsp; JavaFX&nbsp;(which is the technology used in this section) is something that most java developers will rarely or never need to work on.&nbsp; So you could skip that section entirely.&nbsp; But if you are one of the few that need to build user interfaces, then the content is there and ready for you.&nbsp; &nbsp;And there are other sections you can completely avoid if you wish.</p><p>If you want to know absolutely everything about Java, then you can go through the entire course if you wish, but it's not necessary to do so if you are just looking to learn the essential information to get a java developer position.</p><p><strong>What version of Java should you learn?<br><br></strong>Generally speaking, you would want to learn the very latest version of a computer programming language, but <strong>that's not the case</strong> <strong>with Java.</strong></p><p>Oracle, the owner of Java release many versions of Java.&nbsp; Some are released and expire in six months, with no future updates or support. &nbsp;Other versions have long-term support, for many years.</p><p>You can probably see why learning a version of Java that has expired makes no sense, and is likely a waste of time.</p><p>A company using Java technology&nbsp;(big or small) is not going to use a version of Java that has no updates or support.&nbsp; They will stick to stable, well-supported versions of Java that get updates.</p><p>Right now, in December 2022, the version of Java that offers this long-term support&nbsp;(LTS) is Java 17 - It's being fully supported until at least 2029 and likely will be extended from there.</p><p>As such, you want to learn the version of Java that your future employer will use, and that's&nbsp;Java 17.</p><p>The course will also be updated in the future as new LTS versions are announced by Oracle.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>BOTTOM&nbsp;LINE:&nbsp;You will learn the RIGHT VERSION&nbsp;of JAVA in this course!&nbsp; Right meaning the right version to maximize your future Java potential with clients or Employers.</strong></p><p><br><strong>Will this course give me core java skills?</strong></p><p>Yes, it will.&nbsp; Core&nbsp;Java is the fundamental part of the Java JDK (the java development kit) that programmers need to learn to move onto other more advanced technologies.</p><p><strong>Why should you take this course?</strong><br><br>It's been a best-seller since its release on Udemy, you would be joining over 742,000 students who are already enrolled in the course.</p><p>There are well over 174,000 reviews left by students.&nbsp; It's rated as the best course to learn Java for beginners.<br><br><strong>What makes this course a bestseller? </strong></p><p>Like you, thousands of others were frustrated and fed up with fragmented Youtube tutorials or incomplete or outdated courses which assume you already know a bunch of stuff, as well as thick, college-like textbooks able to send even the most caffeine-fuelled coder to sleep. </p><p>Like you, they were tired of low-quality lessons, poorly explained topics, and confusing info presented in the wrong way. That’s why so many find success in this complete Java developer course. It’s designed with simplicity and seamless progression in mind through its content.<br><br>This course assumes <strong>no previous coding experience</strong> and takes you from absolute beginner core concepts, like showing you the free tools you need to download and install, to writing your very first Java program.&nbsp; You will learn the core java skills you need to become employable in around 14 hours, and if you choose to, can take advantage of all the additional content in the course. It's a one-stop shop to learn java. If you want to go beyond the core content you can do so at any time.</p><p><strong>Here’s just some of what you’ll learn</strong></p><p>(It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course)</p><ul><li><p>All the essential Java keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating</p></li><li><p>You will learn the answers to questions like What is a Java class, What is polymorphism and inheritance and to apply them to your java apps.</p></li><li><p>How to safely download and install all necessary coding tools with less time and no frustrating installations or setups</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many aspects of the Java API (the protocols and tools for building applications) so you can code for all platforms and derestrict your program’s user base (and potential sales)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>How to develop powerful Java applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier. &nbsp;<strong>IntelliJ</strong> has both a <strong>FREE</strong> and&nbsp;PAID version, and you can use either in this course.</p></li></ul><p>(Don’t worry if you’re used to using Eclipse, NetBeans, or some other IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course)</p><ul><li><p>Learn Java to a sufficient level to be a be to transition to core Java technologies like Android development, the Spring framework, Java EE&nbsp;(Enterprise edition) in general as well as and other technologies. In order to progress to these technologies, you need to first learn core Java - the fundamental building blocks.&nbsp; That's what this course will help you to achieve.</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>“AP-what?”</em></strong></p><p>Don't worry if none of that made sense. I go into great detail explaining each and every core concept, programming term, and buzzwords you need to create your own Java programs.</p><p>This truly is Java for complete beginners. </p><p>By the end of this comprehensive course, you’ll master Java programming no matter what level of experience you’re at right now. You’ll understand what you are doing, and why you are doing it. This isn’t a recipe book, you’ll use your own creativity to make unique, intuitive programs. </p><p>Not only do these HD videos show you how to become a programmer in great detail, but this course includes a unique <strong>challenge feature</strong>. Each time a core concept is taught, a video presents a challenge for you to help you understand what you have just learned in a <em>real-world scenario.</em></p><p>You’ll go and complete the challenge on your own, then come back and see the answers which I then explain in detail in a video, allowing you to check your results and identify any areas you need to go back and work on.</p><p>This is a proven way to help you <em>understand</em> Java faster and ensure you reach your goal of becoming a Java Developer in record time. Remember doing those old past exam papers in high school or college? It’s the same concept, and it works. </p><p>As your instructor, I have close to&nbsp; <strong>40 years of experience</strong> as a software developer and teacher and have been using Java since the year 2000. Yes, over 22 years <em>(I’ve taught students younger than that)</em>. Meaning not only can I teach this content with great simplicity, but I can make it fun too!</p><p>It’s no surprise my previous students have amazing results...</p><p><strong>See what your fellow students have to say:</strong></p><p>""This course was a guiding light in my ""Becoming a developer"" path from the first step. It helped me become a much more educated developer comparing to my friend who learned to code from trial/error. It's still a guide for me. every now and then I will come back to this course to learn something new or to improve what I've learned somewhere else. A BIG Thanks to ""Tim Buchalka"" my Master."" - Sina Jz<br><br>""I was an absolute beginner when I started this course, and now I can write some good small advanced clean codes. I wrote a code and showed it to a programmer, and he was shocked, he told me that I'm more than ready to start a programming career."" - Amirreza Moeini<br><br>""I am taking this class in conjunction with a Java 101 college class. I have learned more in one afternoon of videos from this class than I have in 4 weeks of a college class. Tim actually explains what things are and why they do what they do, as opposed to my college instructor that mainly said ""go make a program that does *whatever*"" and then I had to figure out a program that would meet those requirements but not actually learning why it worked."" - Stacy Harris<br></p><p>It’s safe to say my students are thrilled with this course, and more importantly, their results, <em>and you can be too</em>…</p><p>This complete Java course will teach you everything you need to know in order to code awesome, profitable projects, <br><br><strong>Is the course updated?</strong></p><p>As mentioned above, yes.</p><p>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released <em>every day</em>, meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.<br><br>A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated.&nbsp; Learning an older version of Java can be counterproductive - you could be learning the ""old way"" of doing things, rather than using current technology.<br><br>Make sure you check the last updated date on the page of any course you plan to buy - you will be shocked to see some have not been updated for years.&nbsp; <br><br>That’s why I’m always adding new, up-to-date content to this course at <strong>no extra charge</strong>. Buy this course once, and you’ll have lifetime access to it and any future updates (which are on the way as we speak). <br><br>And when I say updated, I also mean enhanced.&nbsp; With the recently released Java 17 update, a lot of the content has changed to actually include features included in Java 17.&nbsp; This is not just a ""rebadged"" update - the content is updated with new features of Java.&nbsp; Videos are actually re-recorded, etc.<br><br>With this complete Java Masterclass, you will always have updated, relevant content.</p><p><strong><em>What if I have questions?</em></strong></p><p>As if this course wasn’t complete enough, I offer <strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions you have <strong>7 days a week</strong> (whereas many instructors answer just once per week, <em>or not at all</em>). </p><p>This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With my hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks. </p><p><em>Student Quote: “</em>This course is a great place to ask questions if you have them or find help if you become stuck in areas.<em>” - Blake S.</em></p><p><strong><em>There’s no risk either!</em></strong></p><p>This course comes with a <strong>full 30-day money-back guarantee</strong>. Meaning if you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, simply let me know and I’ll refund you 100%, every last penny no questions asked.</p><p>You either end up with Java skills, go on to develop great programs and potentially make an awesome career for yourself, or you try the course and simply get all your money back if you don’t like it… </p><p><strong>You literally can’t lose.</strong> </p><p><strong>Ready to get started, developer?</strong></p><p><strong>Enroll now </strong>using the “Add to Cart” button on the right, and get started on your way to creative, advanced Java brilliance.

This course assumes&nbsp;you have <strong>NO&nbsp;prior knowledge</strong> and by the end of it you'll be able to&nbsp;<strong>hack systems like black-hat hackers</strong> and <strong>secure them like security experts!</strong></p><p>This&nbsp;course is&nbsp;highly <strong>practical</strong> but it won't neglect the theory; we'll start with ethical hacking basics, breakdown the different penetration testing fields and install the needed software (on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X), then we'll dive and start hacking straight away. You'll <strong>learn everything by example</strong>, by analysing and exploiting different systems such as networks, servers, clients, websites .....etc. We'll never have any boring dry theoretical lectures.</p><p>The course is divided into a number of sections, each section covers a penetration testing / hacking field, in each of these sections you'll first learn how the target system works, the weaknesses of this system, and how to <strong>practically</strong> exploit theses weaknesses to hack this system.</p><p>By the end of the course you will have a strong foundation in most hacking or penetration testing fields and you'll also learn how to <strong>detect, prevent and secure</strong> systems and yourself from&nbsp;the discussed attacks.&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>The course is divided into four main sections:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;Network Hacking</strong><em> -&nbsp;</em>This section will teach you how to test the security of both wired &amp; wireless networks. First, you will learn network basics, how they work, and how devices communicate with each other. Then it will branch into three sub sections:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Pre-connection<strong> </strong>attacks:<em>&nbsp;</em>in this subsection you'll learn a number of attacks that can be executed without connecting to the target network and without the need to know the network password; you'll learn how to&nbsp;<strong>gather&nbsp;information</strong>&nbsp;about the networks around you, discover connected devices, and control connections (<strong>deny/allow devices from connecting to networks</strong>). </p></li><li><p>Gaining Access: Now that you gathered information about&nbsp;the networks around you, in this subsection you will learn how to <strong>crack</strong> the key and get the password to your target network whether it uses<strong> WEP, WPA </strong>or even<strong> WPA2</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Post Connection attacks: Now that you have the key, you can connect to the target network, in this subsection you will learn a number of<strong>&nbsp;powerful techniques</strong>&nbsp;that allow you to gather comprehensive information about the connected devices, <strong>see anything they do on the internet</strong> (such as login information, <strong>passwords</strong>, visited urls, images, videos ....etc), redirect requests, <strong>inject evil code</strong> in loaded pages and much more! All of these attacks work against both wireless and wired networks. You will also learn how to&nbsp;<strong>create a fake WiFi network,</strong>&nbsp;attract users to connect to it and use all of the above techniques against the connected clients.</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>2.&nbsp;Gaining Access</strong><em> -&nbsp;</em>In this section you will learn two main approaches to&nbsp;<strong>gain full control or hack&nbsp;computer systems</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Server Side Attacks<em>: &nbsp;</em>In this subsection you will learn how to&nbsp;<strong>gain full access</strong>&nbsp;to computer systems&nbsp;<strong>without user interaction</strong>. You will learn how to gather useful information about a target computer system such as its&nbsp;operating system,&nbsp;open ports, installed services, then use this information to&nbsp;<strong>discover weaknesses and vulnerabilities</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>exploit</strong>&nbsp;them to gain full control over the target. Finally you will&nbsp;learn how to automatically scan servers for vulnerabilities and generate different types of&nbsp;<strong>reports</strong>&nbsp;with your discoveries.</p></li><li><p>Client Side Attacks<em> -&nbsp;</em>If the target system does not contain any weaknesses then the only way to hack it is by interacting with the users, in this subsection you'll learn how to get the target user to install a backdoor on their system without even realising, this is done by&nbsp;<strong>hijacking software updates</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>backdooring downloads </strong>on the fly. This subsection also teaches you how to use social engineering to hack secure systems, so you'll learn how to gather comprehensive information about system users such as their social accounts, friends, their mails.....etc, you'll learn how to <strong>create trojans</strong> by backdooring normal files (such as an image or a pdf) and use the gathered information to spoof emails so they appear as if they're sent from the target's friend, boss or any email account they're likely to interact with, to social engineer them into running your trojan.</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>3.&nbsp;Post Exploitation</strong><em> -&nbsp;</em>In this section you will learn how to interact with the systems you compromised so far. You’ll&nbsp;learn how to<strong> access the file system </strong>(read/write/upload/execute),&nbsp;<strong>maintain your access</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>spy</strong>&nbsp;on the target (capture key strikes, turn on the webcam, take screenshots....etc) and even&nbsp;use the target computer as a <strong>pivot </strong>to hack other systems.<br></p><p><strong>4.&nbsp;Website / Web Application Hacking</strong><em> -&nbsp;</em>In this section you will learn&nbsp;<strong>how websites work</strong>, how to&nbsp;<strong>gather information</strong>&nbsp;about a target website (such as website owner, server location, used technologies ....etc) and how to&nbsp;<strong>discover </strong>and<strong> exploit </strong>the following dangerous <strong>vulnerabilities</strong> to hack websites:</p><ul><li><p>File Upload.</p></li><li><p>Code Execution.</p></li><li><p>Local File Inclusion.</p></li><li><p>Remote File Inclusion.</p></li><li><p>SQL Injection.</p></li><li><p>Cross Site Scripting (XSS).</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>At the end of each section you will&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;<strong>detect, prevent and secure</strong> systems and yourself from&nbsp;the discussed attacks.&nbsp; </p><p> </p><p>All the techniques in this course are&nbsp;<strong>practical</strong> and work against real systems, you'll understand the whole mechanism of each technique first, then you'll learn how to use it to hack the target system. By the end of the course you'll be able to modify these techniques to launch more powerful attacks, and adopt them to suit different situations and different scenarios.</p><p>With this course you'll get <strong>24/7 support</strong>, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&amp;A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><em>Notes: </em></p><ul><li><p><em>This course is created for educational purposes only,&nbsp;all the attacks are launched in my own lab or against systems that I have permission to test.</em></p></li><li><p><em>This course is totally a product of Zaid Sabih &amp; zSecurity and no other organisation&nbsp;is associated with it or a certification exam. Although, you will receive a Course Completion Certification from Udemy, apart from that NO OTHER ORGANISATION IS INVOLVED.</em></p></li></ul>";https://www.udemy.com/gift/learn-ethical-hacking-from-scratch/;Become an ethical hacker that can hack computer systems like black hat hackers and secure them like security experts.;35;4.5838037;All Levels

It encompasses a wide range of topics.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>Understanding of the data science field and the type of analysis carried out &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Mathematics &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Statistics&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Python&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Applying advanced statistical techniques in Python&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Data Visualization &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Machine Learning &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Deep Learning &nbsp; </p></li></ul><p>Each of these topics builds on the previous ones. And you risk getting lost along the way if you don’t acquire these skills in the right order. For example, one would struggle in the application of Machine Learning techniques before understanding the underlying Mathematics. Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>So, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2023.</em></strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>We believe this is the first training program that solves the biggest challenge to entering the data science field <strong>– having all the necessary resources in one place.</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Moreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course teaches you everything you need to know to become a data scientist at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Skills</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp;Intro to Data and Data Science</strong></p><p>Big data, business intelligence, business analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We know these buzzwords belong to the field of data science but what do they all mean?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>
As a candidate data scientist, you must understand the ins and outs of each of these areas and recognise the appropriate approach to solving a problem. This ‘Intro to data and data science’ will give you a comprehensive look at all these buzzwords and where they fit in the realm of data science.
&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2. Mathematics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Learning the tools is the first step to doing data science. You must first see the big picture to then examine the parts in detail.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>We take a detailed look specifically at calculus and linear algebra as they are the subfields data science relies on.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Calculus and linear algebra are essential for programming in data science. If you want to understand advanced machine learning algorithms, then you need these skills in your arsenal.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3. Statistics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>You need to think like a scientist before you can become a scientist. Statistics trains your mind to frame problems as hypotheses and gives you techniques to test these hypotheses, just like a scientist. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>This course doesn’t just give you the tools you need but teaches you how to use them. Statistics trains you to think like a scientist.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4. Python</strong></p><p>Python is a relatively new programming language and, unlike R, it is a general-purpose programming language. You can do anything with it! Web applications, computer games and data science are among many of its capabilities. That’s why, in a short space of time, it has managed to disrupt many disciplines. Extremely powerful libraries have been developed to enable data manipulation, transformation, and visualisation. Where Python really shines however, is when it deals with machine and deep learning.</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models through powerful frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc, Python is a must have programming language. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5. Tableau</strong></p><p>Data scientists don’t just need to deal with data and solve data driven problems. They also need to convince company executives of the right decisions to make. These executives may not be well versed in data science, so the data scientist must but be able to present and visualise the data’s story in a way they will understand. That’s where Tableau comes in – and we will help you become an expert story teller using the leading visualisation software in business intelligence and data science.</p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>A data scientist relies on business intelligence tools like Tableau to communicate complex results to non-technical decision makers. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>6. Advanced Statistics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Regressions, clustering, and factor analysis are all disciplines that were invented before machine learning. However, now these statistical methods are all performed through machine learning to provide predictions with unparalleled accuracy. This section will look at these techniques in detail. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>Data science is all about predictive modelling and you can become an expert in these methods through this ‘advance statistics’ section. &nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>7. Machine Learning</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The final part of the program and what every section has been leading up to is deep learning. Being able to employ machine and deep learning in their work is what often separates a data <em>scientist </em>from a data <em>analyst. </em>This section covers all common machine learning techniques and deep learning methods with TensorFlow. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Machine learning is everywhere. Companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been using machines that can learn on their own for years. Now is the time for <em>you</em> to control the machines. &nbsp; </p><p><strong>***What you get***</strong></p><ul><li><p>A $1250 data science training program&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Active Q&amp;A support &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>All the knowledge to get hired as a data scientist &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>A community of data science learners &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>A certificate of completion&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Access to future updates &nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Solve real-life business cases that will get you the job&nbsp; &nbsp; </p></li></ul><p><strong>You will become a data scientist from scratch</strong>

No problem, just keep reading...</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>[01] Why should you learn HTML and CSS in the first place?</strong></p><p>Building websites allows you to do <strong>fun and creative work, from anywhere in the world, and it even pays well</strong>. Web development is one of the <strong>most future-proof and highest-paying industries</strong> in the world. And HTML and CSS is the entry point to this world!</p><p>But you already know all this, that's why you want to learn HTML and CSS too. Well, you came to the right place!</p><p>This is the best and most complete course for starting your web development journey that you will find on Udemy. It's an <strong>all-in-one package</strong> that takes you from knowing nothing about HTML and CSS, to building beautiful websites using tools and technologies that professional web developers use every single day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[02] Why is this course so unique and popular?</strong></p><p><strong><em>Reason #1: The course is completely project-based</em></strong></p><p>Simple demos are boring, and therefore you're gonna learn everything by <strong>building actual projects</strong>! In the final project (<em>www.omnifood.dev</em>), together we hand-code a beautiful and responsive landing page for a <strong>fictional company</strong> that I made up just for the course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Reason #2: You will not just learn how to code</em></strong></p><p>Coding is great, but it's not everything! That's why we will go through the entire <strong>7-step process</strong> of building and launching our website project.</p><p>So the huge Omnifood project will teach you <strong>real-world skills to build real-world HTML and CSS websites</strong>: how to plan projects and page layouts, how to implement designs using HTML and CSS techniques, how to write clean and organized code, how to optimize websites for good speed performance, and many more.</p><p>On top of that, this course has a <strong>huge focus on beautiful design</strong>. In fact, this is the only course on the market that focuses on both coding and designing, together.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Reason #3: I'm the right teacher for you</em></strong></p><p>With the right guidance and a well-structured curriculum, building websites can be <strong>quite easy and fun to learn</strong>. With a bunch of random tutorials and YouTube videos? Not so much. And that's where I come in.</p><p>My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2015 to over 200,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.</p><p>Using that feedback, I recently rebuilt this course from scratch and <strong>designed the ideal course curriculum</strong> for every type of student. It's a <strong>unique blend</strong> of projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges. I'm sure you're gonna love it!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[03] Why is this course so long?</strong></p><p><strong>Reason #1:</strong> I take time to <strong>explain every single concept</strong> that I teach, so that you actually learn, and not just copy code from the screen (<strong>this is a course</strong>, not a tutorial)</p><p><strong>Reason #2:</strong> I go into topics that other HTML and CSS courses shy away from: professional web design, component and layout patterns, some CSS theory, website planning in theory and practice, and developer skills. I believe you need all of this to be successful!</p><p><strong>Reason #3:</strong> There is a lot of repetition, so that you actually <strong>assimilate and practice</strong> what you learn. Practice is the single most important ingredient to learning, and therefore I provide plenty of opportunities for you to sharpen your skills</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[04] Here is what's also included in the package:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Up-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy Business students)</p></li><li><p>Professional English captions (not the&nbsp;auto-generated ones)</p></li><li><p>Downloadable design assets + starter code and final code for each section</p></li><li><p>Downloadable slides for 20+ theory videos (not boring, I promise!)</p></li><li><p>Access to countless free design and development resources that I curated over many years</p></li><li><p>Free support in the course Q&amp;A</p></li><li><p>10+ coding challenges to practice your new skills (solutions included)</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>[05] This course is for you if...</strong></p><ul><li><p>... you are a complete beginner with no idea of how to build a website.</p></li><li><p>... you already know a bit of HTML and CSS from some tutorials or videos, but struggle to put together a good-looking, complete website.</p></li><li><p>... you are a designer and want to expand your skills into HTML and CSS, because all your designer friends are learning how to code (they are smart!).</p></li></ul><p>Basically, if you are an HTML and CSS master, and build the most beautiful websites in the world, then DON'T take the course. Everyone else: you should take the course, today.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>So, does all of this sound great?

I work in a school system and unifying data from our various student information systems can be incredibly frustrating, time consuming, and at times challenging. Using your course, I've learned enough to write applications that turn massive text files into dictionaries that get ""stitched"" together like a database and output to properly formatted CSV files and then uploaded via SFTP to various systems for secure processing. Our teachers, students, and the tech department have greatly benefitted from this automation. I just wanted to drop you a note thanking you for helping me learn this skill.” – Keith Medlin<br> <br>“This course was great. Within 3 weeks I was able to write my own database related applications.” – Theo Coenen<br> <br>And there are many more students who love the course – check out all the reviews for yourself.</p><p><strong>Will this course give you core python skills?</strong></p><p>Yes it will.  There are a range of exciting opportunities for Python developers. All of them require a solid understanding of Python, and that’s what you will learn in this course.</p><p><strong>Will the course teach me data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence?</strong></p><p>No, it won’t do that – All of these topics are branches of Python programming.  And all of them require a solid understanding of the Python language.</p><p>Nearly all courses on these topics assume that you understand Python, and without it you will quickly become lost and confused.</p><p>This course will give you that core, solid understanding of the Python programming language.</p><p>By the end of the course you will be ready to apply for Python programming positions as well as move on to specific areas of Python, as listed above. </p><p><strong>Why should you take this course?</strong></p><p>There are a lot of Python courses on Udemy – Your instructors, Tim and Jean-Paul are pretty unique in that between them they have around 70 years of professional programming experience.  That’s more than a lifetime of skills you get to learn Python from.</p><p>You can enrol in the course safe in the knowledge that they are not just teachers, but professional programmers with real commercial programming experience, having worked with big companies like IBM, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu and Saab in the past.</p><p>As such you will not only be learning Python, but you will be learning industry best practices for Python programming that real employers demand.  </p><p>And if that’s not enough take a read of some of the many reviews from happy students – there are around 100,000 students who have left around 19,000 reviews.</p><p>This is one of the most popular courses on Python programming on Udemy.</p><p><strong>Here’s just some of what you’ll learn</strong></p><p>(It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course)</p><p>·       All the essential Python keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating</p><p>·       You will learn the answers to questions like What is the Python For Loop, what is Python used for, how Python switch the traditional syntax of code, and more.</p><p>·       Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many other aspects of Python, including tKInter (for building GUI Interfaces) and using databases with Python.</p><p>·       Although this is primarily a Python 3 course, a python developer will need to work with Python 2 projects from time to time – We’ll show the difference in both versions to make sure you understand how things work differently in each version.</p><p>·        How to develop powerful Python applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier.  <strong>IntelliJ</strong> has both a <strong>FREE</strong> and PAID version, and you can use either in this course.  PyCharm will also work just fine.</p><p>(Don’t worry if you want to use another IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course).<br> <br><strong>Does the course get updated?</strong></p><p>It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released <em>every day</em>, meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.<br> <br> A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated.  Learning from an outdated course and/or an outdated version of Python can be counter productive and even worse it could teach you the wrong way to do things.</p><p>For example if you apply some parts of Python 2 to Python 3 code, you will get completely different results.</p><p>We cover differences like this in the course and also continually update the course as well.</p><p><strong><em>What if you have questions?</em></strong></p><p>As if this course wasn’t complete enough, we offer <strong>full support</strong>, answering any questions you have <strong>7 days a week</strong> (whereas many instructors answer just once per week, <em>or not at all</em>). </p><p>This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With our hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks. </p><p>That’s just one reason why Tim was voted <strong>top 10 in the  Udemy instructor awards</strong> (out of a whopping 18,000 instructors), and quickly became a top-rated, bestselling instructor on the Udemy site.  </p><p><em>Student Quote: “</em>Tim and JP are excellent teachers and are constantly answering questions and surveying students on new topics they will like to learn. This isn't a Python course it’s THE Python course you need.” – Sean Burger</p><p><strong><em>There’s no risk either!</em></strong></p><p>This course comes with a <strong>full 30 day money-back guarantee</strong>. Meaning if you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, simply let Tim or J-P know and they will refund you 100%, every last penny no questions asked.</p><p>You either end up with Python skills, go on to develop great programs and potentially make an awesome career for yourself, or you try the course and simply get all your money back if you don’t like it… </p><p><strong>You literally can’t lose.</strong> </p><p><strong>Ready to get started, developer?</strong></p><p><strong>Enrol now </strong>using the “Add to Cart” button on the right, and get started on your way to creative, advanced Python brilliance.

If you go to GitHub you will see that there are a huge number of active C++ repositories and C++ is also extremely active on stack overflow.</p><p>There are many, many leading software titles written entirely or partly in C++.&nbsp;These include the Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX operating systems!</p><p>Many of the Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator, &nbsp;the MySQL and MongoDB database engines, and many many more are written in C++.</p><p>Leading tech companies use C++ for many of their products and internal research and development. These include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Oracle, and many more.</p><p><strong>Can you see how learning C++ will open up more career opportunities for you?</strong></p><p>If more professional companies are using C++, it stands to reason that there is going to be more of a demand for C++ programmers.</p><p>But the main reason programmers should probably learn C++ &nbsp;is because it is so powerful!</p><p>What do I mean by powerful?</p><p><strong>C++ is&nbsp;super fast and&nbsp;is a general-purpose programming language that supports both procedure and object-oriented programming making it very flexible.</strong></p><p>It can scale easily. And it can be portable as well.</p><p>C++ can do many things that other languages just can't.</p><p>That's why nearly every major language has a way to interface with code written in C++.</p><p>Since C++ has influenced so many languages, if you know C++ you'll likely see elements from C++ in new languages you learn.</p><p><strong>How can a beginner learn C++?</strong><br><br>Find&nbsp;a good course, taught by an instructor with many years of experience in C++ is critical, as is the need for the instructor to have the necessary skills to be able to teach you the language.</p><p>Frank Mitropolous, the instructor in this course has been using C++ for over 2 decades and has taught students in both university courses and industry training courses. &nbsp;He even worked on a C++ compiler development project while he was in the industry.</p><p>So not&nbsp;only will you be learning C++ from an expert C++ programmer, but you'll also be taught by an instructor who has successfully taught&nbsp;at university level for many years.</p><p>As a result, you can take this course with confidence, knowing that you will learn C++ the right way, and in the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p><strong>Which version of C++ should I learn?</strong></p><p>C++ has had many version releases and updates over the years. &nbsp;It's a sad fact that most C++ courses do not teach Modern C++, but focus on old, obsolete versions of C++.</p><p>Frank teaches you Modern C++ (specifically C++ 14 and C++17). &nbsp;</p><p>Learn C++ the right way, with Modern C++, as taught by Frank in this course.</p><p><strong>What about C++20? Don't I need to learn about that as well?</strong></p><p>This course currently covers C++14 and C++17 but is still valid if you ultimately want to learn C++20.&nbsp; </p><p>C++20 is new and the reality is that C++20 compilers and tools are not yet ready for prime time and the industry is using mainly C++14.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So it's not really of any benefit for you to learn C++20 right now when the industry is not using it.&nbsp;</p><p>It's going to take many, many years for the industry to migrate to C++20 and that means jobs for C++20 are not going to be around for quite some time.<br><br>What is available right now, are tons of jobs for Modern C++ developers, and you will obtain those skills in this course. <br><br>It's our sincere advice to focus on learning Modern C++ and not get too hung up on the latest and greatest versions of C++.<br><br>And even if you really do want to learn C++20,&nbsp; the new features in C++20 are mostly advanced features that require understanding the foundations of Modern C++.<br><br>If you don't learn the basics, you won't master any version of C++.</p><p>Learning the foundations of Modern C++ should be your priority, which you will learn in this course!</p><p><strong>Is C++ difficult to learn?</strong></p><p>With all the power and flexibility of C++ comes complexity.</p><p>There is no question that C++ is one of the most complex programming languages out there.</p><p>But with the right instructor and the right training, you really can&nbsp;get up to speed with C++ quickly,&nbsp;and that's what this course is all about.</p><p><strong>What will I learn in this course?</strong></p><p>The course assumes no previous experience with C++ (or even programming in general), and you will end up with the skills to create your own programs in C++.</p><p>Key topics covered include.</p><p>* Looping with while, do/while for, range-based for statements and recursion<br>* Performing calculations and displaying results<br>* Functions<br>* Pointers<br>* Using existing classes and creating objects<br>* Creating your own classes<br>* Using Basic Standard Template Library classes such as Vector<br>* Constructors and Destructors<br>* Copy and Move semantics including Copy constructors, Move constructors, and copy and move assignment&nbsp;<br>* How to overload operators<br>* Using inheritance and class hierarchies<br>* Using Polymorphic functions and dynamic binding&nbsp;<br>* Using smart pointers<br>* Using stream I/O<br>* An introduction to the C++ STL<br>* An introduction to Exception Handling<br>* And much more.</p><p><br><strong>How is this C++ course different from other courses?<br><br></strong>You will learn Modern C++, for one. &nbsp;<strong>Many, perhaps most other courses on Udemy teach you old, obsolete versions of C++.</strong> &nbsp;If you are going to learn C++, it's imperative that you learn the Modern version to maximize your career opportunities and to ensure your skills are up to date.</p><p>The course format includes theory and concepts which are then reinforced with live code examples. Often the C++ debugger is used to step through code and analyze variables to better understand the behavior of C++. The instructor also uses a pen tablet to write on the screen and provide even more visual explanations.</p><p>You won't find better C++ training anywhere, and you will struggle to find someone with as much industry and training experience as&nbsp;your instructor Frank has.</p><p><strong>What do I get out of learning C++?</strong></p><p>More career options for one! &nbsp;C++ is one of the most popular programming languages used in games development. &nbsp; &nbsp;It's also heavily used in embedded applications. &nbsp;Your investment in time in learning C++ will reward you time and time again with more pay, and more opportunities, and frankly, more fun!</p><p><strong>Are you ready to get started?</strong></p><p>If you are ready to get that first paid programming job or to move up to a more senior programming position, then this course is for you! </p><p>Your new job or consulting opportunity&nbsp;awaits! &nbsp;

1430746;The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery;https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/;60272;1;1;https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1430746_2f43_10.jpg;en_US;"<p><strong>Just Updated for 2023!</strong> Become a Fullstack Web Developer by learning the most in demand skills!&nbsp; <strong>Graduates of this course are now working at companies like Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Shopify, JP Morgan, Facebook + other top tech companies (...seriously).</strong></p><p><strong>Join a live online community of over 900,000+ developers and a course taught by an industry expert that has actually worked both in Silicon Valley and Toronto as a Senior Developer and Tech Lead. </strong><br><br>This is <em>the</em> tutorial you've been looking for to <strong>become a modern web developer in 2023.&nbsp;</strong>It doesn’t just cover a small portion of the industry. This covers everything you need to know to get hired: from absolute zero knowledge to being able to put things on your resume that will allow you to live the life you want.&nbsp;</p><p>Sounds too good to be true? Give me 5 minutes of your time to explain why I built this Web&nbsp;Development course and what is different here than thousands of other courses all over the internet:</p><ol><li><p><strong>I update the course every month to make sure you learn the most up to date skills! </strong>There is no wasted time here. We won’t be using outdated technologies like PHP, Wordpress and JQuery. Although still useful, outdated technologies like the above are low paying and demands for them are decreasing. In this course, you will learn the specific technologies that are the most in demand in the industry right now. These include <strong>tools and technologies used by the biggest tech companies like Google, Facebook, Instagram, etc… It is geared specifically for people that want to learn employable skills in 2023.<br><br></strong></p></li><li><p>After finishing this course, you will be able to apply for developer roles, get a promotion, or upgrade your job title as a developer and earn a higher salary. We won't be taking any shortcuts in this course. <strong>You are going to go&nbsp;from absolute zero: where you learn how the internet works. To mastery: where you build an image recognition app using a&nbsp;Machine Learning API (a subset of Artificial Intelligence) and all the other modern technologies that we learn in the course.&nbsp;Most students have commented how the projects in this course have impressed their interviewers and allowed them to get an offer.<br><br></strong></p></li><li><p>This course is taught by an instructor who has worked in Silicon Valley, and one of the top tech companies in Toronto. <strong>I have built large scale applications, and have managed teams of developers. I am not an online marketer or a salesman, but a software developer who has worked directly with these technologies.&nbsp; I love programming and believe that there needs to be a course out there that actually teaches valuable real life skills (because most of them are taught by teachers with no work experience).<br><br></strong></p></li><li><p>Your time is valuable and you don't want to spend thousands of dollars on a bootcamp. You want a course that outlines the best way to become a Web Developer, in simple and well explained terms, so that you fully understand topics instead of watching somebody on your screen and having no clue what is going on.<strong> I have taken the best pieces, tools, and practices that I have found over the years, and condensed everything into this course. 50 hours of videos doesn't mean much if the instructor isn't engaging or focuses on outdated topics.&nbsp;I made sure that everything covered in this course is efficient and focuses on getting you job ready as soon as possible!&nbsp;<br><br></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>We&nbsp;have a thriving online chat community so you really feel like you are part of a classroom and not just watching videos by yourself. </strong>You will have a chance to communicate with fellow students, work on group projects together, and contribute to open source projects. Anytime you have a question, you can ask in many locations and get help right away (including from myself).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>The course is designed to <strong>give you employable skills so you can get a job</strong>. Here is what one student recently wrote after taking the course and being hired right away: <br><br><em>""I’m a self taught dev, who has been out of work for ~6 months. I had some family things that came up that prevented me from seeking permanent employment, so for awhile I was Postmates/Uber delivery driver.<br>&nbsp; <br>After taking this course, I immediately got catapulted back to where I was before, but better equipped and with the knowledge to take on the next job. I had just finished the React section when I went to a recent interview, and it really helped me excel. As of today, I am officially re-employed back in the field, and it is all thanks to this course.&nbsp;I had a blast creating the final project, and FINALLY got around to learning SQL statements, and getting to use them in a project. I’m really ecstatic that Andrei went with teaching relational databases over something like MongoDB, which can also be fun, but is less practical for use on the job.&nbsp; &nbsp;So thanks Andrei&nbsp;, I really enjoyed the course and will be making sure to share it with others who find it helpful. I’m also looking forward to the new ES10 content that was recently added, and going through the DB stuff again when I go to build a personal project."" - J.C.</em></p></li></ol><p><br></p><p>Think of this course like a Web Developer bootcamp. By the end, you will be comfortable using the below skills and you will be able to put them on your resume:</p><ul><li><p><strong>HTML/HTML5</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>CSS/CSS3</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>SemanticUI</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Responsive Design</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Flexbox</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>CSS&nbsp;Grid</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Bootstrap 5</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>DOM Manipulation</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Javascript (including ES6/ES7/ES8/ES9/ES10/ES2020/ES2021/ES2022)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asynchronous JavaScript</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>HTTP/JSON/AJAX</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>React +&nbsp;Redux + React Hooks</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Git + Github</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Command Line</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Node.js</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Express.js</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>NPM</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>RESTful&nbsp;API Design</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>PostgresSQL</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>SQL</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Authentication</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Authorization</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Scalable Infrastructure</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Security</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Production and Deployment</strong></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>You will be taken through online videos and exercises where you will be able to do the following things by the end:<br></p><ul><li><p>Build real complex applications and websites</p></li><li><p>Build an image recognition app so you can add it to your portfolio</p></li><li><p>Go into a job interview confident that you understand the fundamental building blocks of web development and the developer trends in 2023</p></li><li><p>Be able to go off on your own and grow your skills as a developer, having built a solid foundation</p></li><li><p>Learn how frontend, servers, and databases communicate and how they all fit together in the eco system</p></li><li><p>Build your own startup landing page</p></li><li><p>Go off and work remotely by being a freelance developer that can bid on projects</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p>This course is the accumulation of all of my years working in the industry, learning, and teaching. There is so much information out there, so many opinions, and so many ways of doing things, that unless you have spent the last few years working with these technologies in a company, you will never fully understand. So this course is the answer to that&nbsp;exact&nbsp;problem for you: How to gain experience when you need experience to get hired? I have gone through thousands of coding books, online tutorials and bootcamps. <strong>Throughout the years I have taken notes on what has worked and what hasn't, and I have created this course to narrow down the most efficient way to learn with the most relevant information.&nbsp;</strong> </p><p><br></p><p>I am 100% confident that you won't find a course like this out there. We're not going to be building simple todo applications&nbsp;and cat image sliders. We are going to learn actual&nbsp;practical skills that will put you into the workforce. Some unique sections that you won't find anywhere else are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>React.js + Redux:</strong>&nbsp;You will learn the library that companies like Netflix, Facebook and Instagram use to build fast, scalable applications.&nbsp;This is one of the highest in-demand skill in the industry.</p></li><li><p><strong>A day in the life of a developer:</strong>&nbsp;What will your day to day look like and what tools will you&nbsp;use?&nbsp;I will take you through a sample day at a tech company.</p></li><li><p><strong>How does the internet actually work?&nbsp;What is the history of these technologies?:</strong>&nbsp;You will actually understand the underlying concepts of the internet, and how the technologies we have now, have come to be where they are.</p></li><li><p><strong>How do you&nbsp;actually deploy a real life app so that it is secure, and won't get hacked?:</strong>&nbsp;How does a real life app get out to the public in a safe and secure way?</p></li><li><p><strong>What is Machine Learning and how you can&nbsp;harness its power:</strong>&nbsp;Whether you have heard about it or not, this is something that you will hear more and more in the coming years. Those who understand the high level concepts and can harness its power will have an advantage.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>What does your developer environment on your computer look like?:</strong>&nbsp;We will be setting up our computers with all the tools necessary of a developer so you can use the same setup when you go work in the industry.</p></li></ul><p>Why do we teach the above? Because in this day and age, <strong>just knowing HTML CSS&nbsp;and Javascript is not good enough, and you won't be able to grow in your role and command a higher salary. You will learn these things because these are the things you should know in 2023 so that you are miles ahead of the rest.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Make this&nbsp;the year that you took a risk, you learned&nbsp;highly in demand skills, you had new experiences, and you received new opportunities. I hope you join me in this journey. <br><br><strong>This is the proudest work I have ever done in my life and I am confident that you won't find a course better than this. </strong><br><br>See you inside!</p><p>

Remember, the average salary of a SQL developer is $103,400! That’s a lucrative career.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>How come?&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p><p>Well, when you can work with SQL, it means you don’t have to rely on others sending you data and executing queries for you. You can do that on your own. This allows you to be independent and dig deeper into the data to obtain the answers to questions that might improve the way your company does its business. For instance, Database management is the foundation for data analysis and intelligent decision making.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Worried that you have no previous experience?</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>Not an issue. We will start from the very basics and gradually teach you everything you need to know. Step by step. With no steps skipped.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>Why take this course in particular? Isn’t it like the rest of the SQL courses out there?</strong> &nbsp; </p><p>We would like to think it isn’t. Our team worked hard to create a course that is:

&nbsp; </p><ul><li><p>Easy to understand

&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Time efficient and concise

&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Shows how SQL can be crucial for data analytics and business intelligence&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Comprehensive – it covers several topics not shown in other SQL courses&nbsp; &nbsp; </p></li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Practical – it teaches you how to work with a real-life database&nbsp; &nbsp; </p></li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Corresponds to professional best practices

&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Taught in MySQL – The most popular SQL database management system

&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Contains plenty of downloadable exercises, course notes, and quiz questions&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Some of these aspects have been covered in other courses. Others haven’t. However, no one provides such a variety of topics in one place.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We firmly believe this course is the best training material out there. It is a truly interactive experience preparing you for a real-life working environment.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>We love teaching</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>So far, over 1,750,000 students have taken our courses here on Udemy. Teaching is what we do best, and we take pride in going the extra mile to create the most engaging content for you, our students. Our mission is to help you bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge taught at school and in universities and the practical application required at the workplace.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><strong>So, why do you need to enroll in this course and learn SQL?</strong>

&nbsp; </p><ol><li><p><strong>Salary/Income.</strong> As we pointed out earlier, learning SQL is a great opportunity. There is a significant surge in demand for skills revolving around database management, database administration, and business analysis relying on data. Companies will pay top dollars for specialists who have such know-how

&nbsp; </p></li><li><p><strong>Profession of the future.</strong> In the years to come, data will only grow in importance and size. Therefore, it is great to pick up a skill that will likely increase in demand over the years to come

&nbsp; </p></li><li><p><strong>Analytical reasoning.</strong> Programming languages are a great way to train your mind. Furthermore, understanding a business task and looking for its solution through writing code can be really interesting and stimulating once you become familiar with the basics &nbsp; </p></li></ol><p><strong>What about certificates? Do you provide a certificate?</strong></p><p>Upon completion of the course, you will be able to download a certificate of completion with your name on it. Then, you can upload this certificate on LinkedIn and show potential employers this is a skill you possess. &nbsp; </p><p>Sounds awesome, right?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>So, what are you waiting for?

Angela, you're awesome! I already rated the course as 5 stars early on (at about 20% completion), but after completing roughly 70% of the course, I can say this is my favourite Udemy course as of today.

1151632;Deep Learning A-Z™ 2023: Neural Networks, AI & ChatGPT Bonus;https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/;53692;1;2;https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1151632_de9b.jpg;en_US;"<p>*** As seen on Kickstarter ***</p><p>Artificial intelligence is growing exponentially. There is no doubt about that. Self-driving cars are clocking up millions of miles, IBM Watson is diagnosing patients better than armies of doctors and Google Deepmind's AlphaGo beat the World champion at Go - a game where intuition plays a key role.

  </p>

<p>But the further AI advances, the more complex become the problems it needs to solve. And only Deep Learning can solve such complex problems and that's why it's at the heart of Artificial intelligence.

  </p>



<p><strong>--- Why Deep Learning A-Z? ---</strong>

  </p>



<p>Here are five reasons we think Deep Learning A-Z™ really is different, and stands out from the crowd of other training programs out there:

  </p>



<p><strong>1. ROBUST STRUCTURE </strong>

  </p>



<p>The first and most important thing we focused on is giving the course a robust structure. Deep Learning is very broad and complex and to navigate this maze you need a clear and global vision of it. 

  </p>



<p>That's why we grouped the tutorials into two volumes, representing the two fundamental branches of Deep Learning: Supervised Deep Learning and Unsupervised Deep Learning. With each volume focusing on three distinct algorithms, we found that this is the best structure for mastering Deep Learning.

  </p>



<p><strong>2. INTUITION TUTORIALS</strong>

  </p>



<p>So many courses and books just bombard you with the theory, and math, and coding... But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part: <strong>why you are doing what you are doing. </strong>And that's how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive <em>*feel*</em> for the concepts behind Deep Learning algorithms.

  </p>



<p>With our intuition tutorials you will be confident that you understand all the techniques on an instinctive level. And once you proceed to the hands-on coding exercises you will see for yourself how much more meaningful your experience will be. This is a game-changer.

  </p>



<p><strong>3. EXCITING PROJECTS</strong>

  </p>



<p>Are you tired of courses based on over-used, outdated data sets?

  </p>



<p>Yes? Well then you're in for a treat.

  </p>



<p>Inside this class we will work on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. (Definitely not the boring iris or digit classification datasets that we see in every course). In this course we will solve six real-world challenges:

  </p>



<ul><li>Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem

  </li><li>Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition

  </li><li>Recurrent Neural Networks to predict Stock Prices

  </li><li>Self-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud

  </li><li>Boltzmann Machines to create a Recomender System

  </li><li>Stacked Autoencoders* to take on the challenge for the <strong>Netflix $1 Million prize</strong>

  </li></ul>



<p><em>*Stacked Autoencoders is a brand new technique in Deep Learning which didn't even exist a couple of years ago. We haven't seen this method explained anywhere else in sufficient depth.</em>

  </p>



<p><strong>4. HANDS-ON CODING </strong>

  </p>



<p>In Deep Learning A-Z™ we code together with you. Every practical tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means. 

  </p>



<p>In addition, we will purposefully structure the code in such a way so that you can download it and apply it in your own projects. Moreover, we explain step-by-step where and how to modify the code to insert YOUR dataset, to tailor the algorithm to your needs, to get the output that you are after. 

  </p>



<p>This is a course which naturally extends into your career.

  </p>



<p><strong>5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT</strong>

  </p>



<p>Have you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author? 

  </p>



<p>Well, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful Deep Learning course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help.

  </p>



<p>In fact, since we physically also need to eat and sleep we have put together a team of professional Data Scientists to help us out. Whenever you ask a question you will get a response from us within 48 hours maximum. 

  </p>



<p>No matter how complex your query, we will be there. The bottom line is we want you to succeed. 

  </p>



<p><strong>--- The Tools ---</strong>

  </p>



<p>Tensorflow and Pytorch are the two most popular open-source libraries for Deep Learning. In this course you will learn both!

  </p>



<p>TensorFlow was developed by Google and is used in their speech recognition system, in the new google photos product, gmail, google search and much more. Companies using Tensorflow include AirBnb, Airbus, Ebay, Intel, Uber and dozens more. 

  </p>



<p>PyTorch is as just as powerful and is being developed by researchers at Nvidia and leading universities: Stanford, Oxford, ParisTech. Companies using PyTorch include Twitter, Saleforce and Facebook.

  </p>



<p>So which is better and for what? 

  </p>



<p>Well, in this course you will have an opportunity to work with both and understand when Tensorflow is better and when PyTorch is the way to go. Throughout the tutorials we compare the two and give you tips and ideas on which could work best in certain circumstances.

  </p>



<p>The interesting thing is that both these libraries are barely over 1 year old. That's what we mean when we say that in this course we teach you the most cutting edge Deep Learning models and techniques.

  </p>



<p><strong>--- More Tools ---</strong>

  </p>



<p><em>Theano </em>is another open source deep learning library. It's very similar to Tensorflow in its functionality, but nevertheless we will still cover it.

  </p>



<p><em>Keras </em>is an incredible library to implement Deep Learning models. It acts as a wrapper for Theano and Tensorflow. Thanks to Keras we can create powerful and complex Deep Learning models with only a few lines of code. This is what will allow you to have a global vision of what you are creating. Everything you make will look so clear and structured thanks to this library, that you will really get the intuition and understanding of what you are doing.

  </p>



<p><strong>--- Even More Tools ---</strong>

  </p>



<p><em>Scikit-learn </em>the most practical Machine Learning library. We will mainly use it:  

  </p>



<ul><li>to evaluate the performance of our models with the most relevant technique, k-Fold Cross Validation

  </li><li>to improve our models with effective Parameter Tuning

  </li><li>to preprocess our data, so that our models can learn in the best conditions

  </li></ul>



<p>And of course, we have to mention the usual suspects. This whole course is based on Python and in every single section you will be getting hours and hours of invaluable hands-on practical coding experience. 

  </p>



<p>Plus, throughout the course we will be using Numpy to do high computations and manipulate high dimensional arrays, Matplotlib to plot insightful charts and Pandas to import and manipulate datasets the most efficiently.

  </p>



<p><strong>--- Who Is This Course For? ---</strong>

  </p>



<p>As you can see, there are lots of different tools in the space of Deep Learning and in this course we make sure to show you the most important and most progressive ones so that when you're done with Deep Learning A-Z™ your skills are on the cutting edge of today's technology.

  </p>



<p><strong>If you are just starting out into Deep Learning, </strong>then you will find this course extremely useful. Deep Learning A-Z™ is structured around special coding blueprint approaches meaning that you won't get bogged down in unnecessary programming or mathematical complexities and instead you will be applying Deep Learning techniques from very early on in the course. You will build your knowledge from the ground up and you will see how with every tutorial you are getting more and more confident.

  </p>



<p><strong>If you already have experience with Deep Learning, </strong>you will find this course refreshing, inspiring and very practical. Inside Deep Learning A-Z™ you will master some of the most cutting-edge Deep Learning algorithms and techniques (some of which didn't even exist a year ago) and through this course you will gain an immense amount of valuable hands-on experience with real-world business challenges. Plus, inside you will find inspiration to explore new Deep Learning skills and applications.

  </p>



<p><strong>--- Real-World Case Studies ---</strong>

  </p>



<p>Mastering Deep Learning is not just about knowing the intuition and tools, it's also about being able to apply these models to real-world scenarios and derive actual measurable results for the business or project. That's why in this course we are introducing six exciting challenges:

  </p>



<p><strong>#1 Churn Modelling Problem</strong>

  </p>



<p>In this part you will be solving a data analytics challenge for a bank. You will be given a dataset with a large sample of the bank's customers. To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank. 

  </p>



<p>Your goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). Besides, you are asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of leaving. To do that, you will need to use the right Deep Learning model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach. 

  </p>



<p>If you succeed in this project, you will create significant added value to the bank. By applying your Deep Learning model the bank may significantly reduce customer churn.

  </p>



<p><strong>#2 Image Recognition</strong>

  </p>



<p>In this part, you will create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. We will implement this Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else and we will show you how to do it - by simply changing the pictures in the input folder. 

  </p>



<p>For example, you will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then you will literally be able to a take a picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have. We even tested it out on Hadelin’s dog!

  </p>



<p><strong>#3 Stock Price Prediction</strong>

  </p>



<p>In this part, you will create one of the most powerful Deep Learning models. We will even go as far as saying that you will create the Deep Learning model closest to <em>“Artificial Intelligence”</em>. Why is that? Because this model will have long-term memory, just like us, humans. 

  </p>



<p>The branch of Deep Learning which facilitates this is Recurrent Neural Networks. Classic RNNs have short memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason. But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural Networks gave rise to the popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field. We are extremely excited to include these cutting-edge deep learning methods in our course! 

  </p>



<p>In this part you will learn how to implement this ultra-powerful model, and we will take the challenge to use it to predict the real Google stock price. A similar challenge has already been faced by researchers at Stanford University and we will aim to do at least as good as them. 

  </p>



<p><strong> #4 Fraud Detection</strong>

  </p>



<p>According to a recent report published by Markets &amp; Markets the Fraud Detection and Prevention Market is going to be worth $33.19 Billion USD by 2021. This is a huge industry and the demand for advanced Deep Learning skills is only going to grow. That’s why we have included this case study in the course.  

  </p>



<p>This is the first part of Volume 2 - Unsupervised Deep Learning Models. The business challenge here is about detecting fraud in credit card applications. You will be creating a Deep Learning model for a bank and you are given a dataset that contains information on customers applying for an advanced credit card. 

  </p>



<p>This is the data that customers provided when filling the application form. Your task is to detect potential fraud within these applications. That means that by the end of the challenge, you will literally come up with an explicit list of customers who potentially cheated on their applications.

  </p>



<p><strong>#5 &amp; 6 Recommender Systems</strong>

  </p>



<p>From Amazon product suggestions to Netflix movie recommendations - good recommender systems are very valuable in today's World. And specialists who can create them are some of the top-paid Data Scientists on the planet.

  </p>



<p>We will work on a dataset that has exactly the same features as the Netflix dataset: plenty of movies, thousands of users, who have rated the movies they watched. The ratings go from 1 to 5, exactly like in the Netflix dataset, which makes the Recommender System more complex to build than if the ratings were simply “Liked” or “Not Liked”. 

  </p>



<p>Your final Recommender System will be able to predict the ratings of the movies the customers didn’t watch. Accordingly, by ranking the predictions from 5 down to 1, your Deep Learning model will be able to recommend which movies each user should watch. Creating such a powerful Recommender System is quite a challenge so we will give ourselves two shots. Meaning we will build it with two different Deep Learning models.

  </p>



<p>Our first model will be Deep Belief Networks, complex Boltzmann Machines that will be covered in Part 5. Then our second model will be with the powerful AutoEncoders, my personal favorites. You will appreciate the contrast between their simplicity, and what they are capable of.

  </p>



<p>And you will even be able to apply it to yourself or your friends. The list of movies will be explicit so you will simply need to rate the movies you already watched, input your ratings in the dataset, execute your model and voila! The Recommender System will tell you exactly which movies you would love one night you if are out of ideas of what to watch on Netflix!  

  </p>



<p><strong>--- Summary ---</strong>

  </p>



<p>In conclusion, this is an exciting training program filled with intuition tutorials, practical exercises and real-World case studies. 

  </p>



<p>We are super enthusiastic about Deep Learning and hope to see you inside the class!

The unfortunate truth is that on Udemy</strong> most instructors do not answer questions at all even though Udemy provides a spot in the course for that. How disappointing. Other instructors have a ""Team"" that is really a low cost outsource provider who answers questions and provides general 1 or 2 sentence answers, if that. What a rip off. The instructor in this course answers all questions with detailed responses and provides supplemental links and resources to support the answer. Many students like to go though and read the Q&amp;A and consider it like a blog that really aids learning on its own.</p><p><strong><em>""Steve has never disappointed me! I love all his courses.

The way he has prepared the material and the way he teaches is really awesome. What an effort .. Thanks a million </p><p><strong>5 STARS -</strong> A lot of preparation work has taken place from the teacher and this is visible throughout the course. </p><p><strong>5 STARS -</strong> This guy is fantastic. Really. Wonderful teaching skills, and goes well out of his way to make sure that everything he is doing is fully understood. This is the kind of tutorial that gets me excited to work with a framework that I may otherwise not be. </p><p><strong>5 STARS -</strong> The best part of it is the hands-on approach which the author maintained throughout the course as he had promised at the beginning of the lecture. He explains the concepts really well and also makes sure that there is not a single line of code you type without understanding what it really does. </p><p><strong>5 STARS -</strong> I also appreciate the mind and hands approach of teaching something and then having the student apply it. It makes everything a lot clearer for the student and uncovers issues that we will face in our project early. </p><p><strong>5 STARS -</strong> Amazing course. Explained super difficult concepts (that I have spent hours on the internet finding a good explanation) in under 5 minutes.</p><p><strong>Start Learning Now.</strong> Hit the Enroll Button!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>STEP&nbsp;BY&nbsp;STEP&nbsp;DETAILS</strong></p><p><strong><em>RESTful Web Services&nbsp;</em></strong></p><ul><li><p>Step 01 -

I am writing this email to give good feedback regarding your course materials that I&nbsp;have watched from Udemy.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have completed your Linux course and I would like to mention that it has been nothing but awesome.&nbsp; Your course has allowed me to obtain a Linux certification and I would like to give a big thanks you for that.&nbsp; Please continue what you're doing and I wish you the very best.&nbsp; <strong>-- Yusuf Ishkandersha</strong></p><p><br></p></li><li><p>Imran is a very knowledgeable and engaging instructor. As others have said, you can tell that he is not just trying to sell a course, but that he is invested in giving his students a strong career foundation with a positive and approachable attitude. He is also entertaining with his use of pop culture and practical work examples. It really feels like you're in a classroom with him. I'm taking this course mainly as a hobbyist, but got a lot from it already. The homework assignments, quizzes, and handouts help reinforce the material.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>-- Raymond B.</strong></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>I just love the teaching ad the learning experience I am getting&nbsp; <strong>-- Jacob Samba (Udemy Student)</strong></p></li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Imran Afzal might be my favorite teacher I've EVER had. He is funny, and engaging. The course was easy to follow, and with no experience starting I am now extremely comfortable with Linux, and actually really like it. He does make you do your googles, but this is not a bad thing especially considering the nature of IT and documentation to solve your own problems. I highly recommend.&nbsp; <strong>-- Vanessa Diaz-Goumond (Udemy Student)</strong></p></li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><p>The course is run very well and I really like the handouts and the homework that is assigned. The homework helps me learn and continue with the learning process even when adult life is still progressing forward.&nbsp; <strong>-- Thomas Rogers (Udemy Student)</strong></p></li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Such an amazing instructor. Imran must have put in a lot of effort in structuring the course and taking the student step by step, he takes his time in explaining everything, from what Linux is, how to down load it, coding, etc. I have taken other courses from Imran. I am a student for life. Keep it up and please keep preparing more courses for please like us who can benefit from your way of teaching, knowledge and experience. Thank you.&nbsp; <strong>-- Ali Shiekh (Udemy Student)</strong></p></li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><p>In the first place I say a big thank you to the instructor for making such a great course. I was afraid to learn Linux. I now feel very comfortable with Linux. I have understood both the concept behind and the practical as well. I would recommend every one who is NEW to Linux and wants to grab it once and for all without wasting time to go ahead and ENROLL. You will not regret it. I would like the instructor to do same for WINDOWS SERVER ADMIN., I don't seem to find any better and beginner oriented course out there that could be matched with this course. To me, it is the BEST Linux Course on Online. I just started some real world projects with Linux after this great course, I was new to Linux and in just a month I am on the command line always playing.&nbsp; <strong>-- Opoku Bright (Udemy Student)</strong></p></li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><p>I genuinely look forward to additional courses in the future.

Fortunately, the second best time is today!&nbsp; Git is an essential tool for work in any code-related field, from data science to game development to machine learning.&nbsp; This course covers everything you need to know to start using Git and Github in the real-world today!</p><p>The course's 20+ sections are broken down into four separate units:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Git Essentials </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Next Level Git</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Github &amp; Collaboration</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The Tricky Bits</strong></p></li></ul><p>We start off with <strong>Git Essentials.</strong>&nbsp; The goal of this unit is to give you all the essential Git tools you need for daily use.&nbsp; We start off talking about version control software, what it is, why it matters, and the history of Git.&nbsp; Then we install Git and run through the Unix commands you'll need to work with Git (you can skip this if you're already familiar).&nbsp; The bulk of this unit is focused on teaching the core Git mechanics like <strong>committing </strong>and <strong>branching</strong> and the associated concepts: the working directory, the repository, the staging area, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; We cover Git commands including: git init, git add, git commit, git status, git log, git branch, and git merge.&nbsp; We end with a detailed look at branching, <strong>merging</strong>, and <strong>resolving conflicts</strong>. </p><p>Then we move on to out <strong>Next Level Git </strong>unit, where we cover additional commands and Git concepts that are extremely useful, but maybe not as ""core"" as the Git Essentials.&nbsp; We start with a comprehensive look at the <strong>gif diff</strong> command and the various comparisons that we can make between commits, branches, the working directory, the staging area, and more!&nbsp; We pay special attention to reading and parsing the dense output generated by diffs.&nbsp; Then we shift our focus to stashing with the <strong>git stash </strong>command, a ""convenience command"" that many users love incorporating into their Git workflow.&nbsp; Finally, we dive deep into <strong>undoing changes and time traveling</strong> with Git.&nbsp; We learn how to revisit earlier work, detach and re-attach HEAD, and discard changes.&nbsp; We cover git commands that help us undo changes including <strong>git checkout</strong>, <strong>git restore</strong>, <strong>git reset</strong>, and <strong>git revert</strong>.</p><p>Next up, we change gears to focus on <strong>Github &amp; Collaboration</strong>.&nbsp; We start by exploring Github (and similar tools) that host remote repositories and discussing the benefits they provide.&nbsp; We create our own Github repositories and sync up changes between our remote and local repositories using the <strong>git push</strong>, <strong>git pull</strong>, and <strong>git fetch</strong> commands.&nbsp; We then focus on commonly used <strong>collaboration workflows</strong> that students may encounter in the real world: <strong>feature branching</strong>, <strong>pull requests</strong>, <strong>forking &amp; cloning</strong>, and more! We discuss <strong>contributing to open source </strong>projects and configuring Github repositories for collaboration. We also spend some time learning about useful Github features including Github <strong>Gists </strong>and <strong>Github Pages</strong> for free static hosting.</p><p>The last unit in the course, <strong>The Tricky Bits</strong>, is really just a collection of useful Git command and advanced topics.&nbsp; We start by covering one of the ""scarier"" Git commands: <strong>rebasing</strong>!&nbsp; We discuss the potential benefits and pitfalls of rebasing and compare it to merging.&nbsp; Then we learn how to clean up our Git history by rewording, editing, dropping, and <strong>squashing</strong> commits using the <strong>interactive rebase</strong> command.&nbsp; Next, we discuss <strong>Git tags</strong> (lightweight and <strong>annotated tags</strong>) semantic versioning and tagging workflows.&nbsp; After that, we move on to a deep dive into the inner workings of Git.&nbsp; We discuss the files and folders Git uses internally, the role of <strong>hashing</strong> functions in Git, and the role of Git objects (<strong>blobs</strong>, <strong>trees</strong>, etc.). Next, we talk about reference logs and the <strong>git reflog</strong> command.&nbsp; Specifically, we learn how we can use reflogs to rescue ""lost"" commits and <strong>undo rebases</strong>.&nbsp; Finally, we learn how to write custom and powerful <strong>Git aliases</strong>!</p><p>Throughout the course, you'll find tons and tons of diagrams and visual references I've created to try and explain Git.&nbsp; The course also includes exercises I've tested on my in-person students, to give you an opportunity to practice the concepts in the course along the way.&nbsp; If you are reading this sentence, I congratulate you on making it this far :) I&nbsp;hope you enjoy the course!</p>";https://www.udemy.com/gift/git-and-github-bootcamp/;Master the essentials and the tricky bits: rebasing, squashing, stashing, reflogs, blobs, trees, & more!;79;4.771875;Beginner Level

1467808;C Programming For Beginners - Master the C Language;https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-for-beginners-/;53692;1;2;https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/1467808_f8c0.jpg;en_US;"<p>Have you never programmed a computer before, and think or have been told that C is a good programming language to get started with.  <strong>It is!</strong></p>

<p>Maybe you have some experience with other programming languages, but want to learn C.  <strong>It's a great language to add to your resume!</strong></p>



<p>Or perhaps you are stuck in a low paying programming job, and want to move up to a better, more senior position.  <strong>Learning C can help you!</strong><br></p>



<p>The fact is, learning how to program in C is not only an excellent programming language to get started with, but it will also make you a better programming in other computer languages!</p>



<p><strong>Why learn C ?</strong><br></p>



<p>C is often considered to be the mother of all languages because so many other languages have been based on it.</p>



<p>Though C is simple it is one of the <strong>most powerful languages ever created</strong>.  Considering it was created over 40 years ago, it is still used heavily and is usually in the top 5 or 10 most popular and most widely programming languages in the world.<br></p>



<p>Learning C can actually make you a better programming in other languages like C++, Java, or C# by equipping you with a mental model of what the computer is actually doing when you run your programs.<br><br>By learning how things really work ""under the hood"", and understand memory space, CPU architecture and so on, you can create more efficient programs, and obtain a huge advantage over other programmers in the process.</p>



<p>If you want to become a better developer, learning C is a great way to start!</p>



<p><strong><strong></strong>Why enrolling in this course is the best decision you can make.</strong><br></p>





<p>By the end of this course, you will understand the fundamentals of the C Programming Language, and make yourself more marketable for entry level programming positions.</p>



<p>You will understand variables and the different data types, be able to utilize functions and arrays, understand the  concept of pointers, learn about control flow (decision statements and iteration).</p>



<p>You will be in a position to apply for real-time programming positions, and truly understand the core language that most modern languages are based on!</p>



<p>If you have previously used the C programming language, then this course will deepen your understanding of it. If you have never used it, no problem, you will see that it can help you become a more efficient C developer.<br></p>





<p>The course will be constantly refined in the future based on student feedback!</p>



<p><strong>This course does not skip on the details.  You will learn how to write high quality code and become an excellent problem solver.  This course does not just present how to code in the C programming language, but, also includes all the details on ""why"" you are doing the things you are doing.  At the end of this course, you will fully understand the concepts of the C Programming language.<br></strong></p>



<p>Your instructor, Jason Fedin has been teaching students for over 12 years via online classes at over 10 different online Universities. He has created many different class curriculums, ranging from mobile programming to bash scripting to Object-Oriented Design and of course the C programming language.</p>



<p>Additionally, he has been developing software for over 16 years in the real world at various companies, specializing in Object-Oriented Development and Mobile Applications.</p>





<p>This means you are learning from someone who has all the professional training, skills, and experience you need to teach you how to become proficient in the C programming language.</p>

<p>If you are ready to get that first paid programming job, or to move up to a more senior programming position, then this course is for you!<br></p>





<p>Your new job or consulting opportunity awaits!  <br></p>

Join a live online community of over 900,000+ developers and a course taught by industry experts that have actually worked both in Silicon Valley and Toronto with React.js.</strong> <br><br>Using the latest version of React <em>(React 18)</em>, this course is focused on efficiency. Never spend time on confusing, out of date, incomplete tutorials anymore. <strong>Graduates of Andrei’s courses are now working at Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, IBM, JP Morgan, Meta, + other top tech companies.</strong></p><p>We guarantee you this is the most comprehensive online resource on React. This project based course will introduce you to all of the modern toolchain of a React developer in 2023. Along the way, we will build a massive e-commerce application similar to Shopify using React, Redux, React Hooks, React Suspense, React Router, GraphQL, Context API, Firebase, Redux-Saga, Stripe + more. This is going to be a full stack app (MERN stack), using Firebase.</p><p>The curriculum is going to be very hands on as we walk you from start to finish of releasing a professional React project all the way into production.&nbsp;We will start from the very beginning by teaching you React Basics and then going into advanced topics so you can make good decisions on architecture and tools on any of your future ReactJS projects. </p><p>All code is going to be provided step by step and even if you don’t like to code along, you will get access to the the full master project code so anyone signed up for the course will have their own project to put on their portfolio right away.<br><br>The topics covered will be:</p><p><strong>- React Basics</strong></p><p><strong>- React Router</strong></p><p><strong>- Redux</strong></p><p><strong>- Redux&nbsp;Saga</strong></p><p><strong>- Asynchronous Redux</strong></p><p><strong>- React Hooks</strong></p><p><strong>- Context API</strong></p><p><strong>- React Suspense + React Lazy</strong></p><p><strong>- Firebase</strong></p><p><strong>-&nbsp;Stripe API</strong></p><p><strong>- Styled-Components</strong></p><p><strong>- GraphQL</strong></p><p><strong>- Apollo</strong></p><p><strong>- PWAs</strong></p><p><strong>- React Performance</strong></p><p><strong>- React Design Patterns</strong></p><p><strong>- Testing with Jest and Snapshot testing</strong></p><p><strong>- React Best Practices</strong></p><p><strong>- Persistance + Session Storage</strong></p><p><strong>- State Normalization</strong></p><p><strong>+ more</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Wait wait… I know what you’re thinking. Why aren’t we building 10+ projects? Well, here’s the truth: Most courses teach you React and do just that. They show you how to get started, build 10 projects that are simple and easy to build in a day, and just add some CSS to make them look fancy. In real life though, you’re not building silly applications. When you apply to jobs, nobody is going to care that you built a really pretty To Do app. Employers want to see you build large apps that can scale, that have good architecture, and that can be deployed to production.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Let me tell you 3 reasons why this course is different from any other React tutorial online:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>1</strong>. You will build the biggest project you will see in any course. This type of project would take you months to implement yourself.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2.</strong> This course is taught by 2 instructors that have actually worked for some of the biggest tech firms using React in production. Yihua has been working on some of the biggest e-commerce websites that you have definitely heard of and probably have shopped at. Andrei has worked on enterprise level React applications for large IPOed tech firms in Silicon Valley as well as Toronto. By having both of them teach, you get to see different perspective and learn from 2 senior developers as if you are working at a company together.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3.</strong> We learn principles that are important beyond just what you learn as a beginner. Using the instructor's experiences you learn about design patterns, how to architect your app, organize your code, structure your folders, and how to think about performance. Let’s just say we don’t shy away from the advanced topics.</p><p><br></p><p>This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No! <strong>This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner in React to someone that is in the top 10% of React developers.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Taught By:<br></strong></p><p>Andrei&nbsp;Neagoie is the instructor of the <strong>highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well as&nbsp;one of the fastest&nbsp;growing.&nbsp;</strong>His graduates have&nbsp;moved&nbsp;on to work for&nbsp;some of the biggest tech&nbsp;companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc...&nbsp;He&nbsp;has&nbsp;been working as a senior software developer in&nbsp;Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years,&nbsp;and&nbsp;is now taking all that he has learned,&nbsp;to teach&nbsp;programming skills and&nbsp;to help you&nbsp;discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in&nbsp;life.&nbsp;</p><p>Having been&nbsp;a self taught programmer,&nbsp;he understands that there is an&nbsp;overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books&nbsp;that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills.&nbsp;Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.&nbsp;<strong>Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material&nbsp;should teach real life skills that are current and&nbsp;they should not waste a student's valuable time.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having learned important&nbsp;lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even&nbsp;founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to&nbsp;teaching others valuable&nbsp;software development skills&nbsp;in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.&nbsp;<strong>He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>See you inside the courses!<br><br>--------<br><br>Yihua Zhang is one of the Instructors of Zero To Mastery, one of the highest rated and fastest growing Web Development academies on Udemy</strong>. He has been working as a software developer for numerous years in Toronto for some of the largest tech companies in the world. He has also been working as an instructor for more than a decade. He is focused on bringing everything he has learned to help you achieve a new career as a developer, but also give you all the fundamental skills required to flourish in this incredible industry.</p><p><br></p><p>Yihua is a self taught developer, so he fully understands the challenges and mindset of coming into this industry from various other backgrounds. He has been on both sides of the table, as both an instructor and student numerous times so he can empathize with the difficulty of learning something new and challenging. Learning itself is a skill that needs to be practiced and improved upon, and he is dedicated to helping you improve and master that skill for yourself. Courses need to be practical, you need to be able to understand why you are learning the things that you are being taught. You need to understand the problem before you know the solution, and he prides himself on teaching you how to build professional, real world applications so you truly understand why you are doing things a specific way. He will teach you the mindset and skillset required to grow as a developer as fast as possible, so you can have the rich and fulfilling life that comes with this career.</p><p><br></p><p>Yihua's courses will guide you to build beautifully written and richly featured applications, while truly understanding all the complex concepts you will encounter along the way.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>";https://www.udemy.com/gift/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/;Updated!

So I have created a course that makes this path as easy as possible all with the help of c# so that you become a skilled c# developer!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You start off by learning the C# basics and C# programming concepts in general:</strong></p><ul><li><p>variables</p></li><li><p>methods</p></li><li><p>arrays</p></li><li><p>if statements</p></li><li><p>loops</p></li></ul><p><strong>Then you learn the three pillars of Object-oriented programming.</strong></p><ul><li><p>Classes and Objects</p></li><li><p>Inheritance</p></li><li><p>Polymorphism</p></li></ul><p>Once you mastered them, you will go into advanced C# Topics, such as <strong>Databases and LINQ.</strong></p><p>In order to really become really good in c# programming, you have to program yourself, so I have created loads of exercises (and quizzes) for you to try for yourself to do c# programming and also to see how it is done afterward. <strong>Of course, you learn best programming practices along the way.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Equipped with those skills, you will build <strong>beautiful user interfaces with WPF</strong> - A framework, which makes creating GUI’s a piece of cake.<br><strong>By that point, you can create your very own complex programs.<br></strong>But what comes next is even cooler.</p><p><strong>Learn Game Development with Unity and C# - Build 2 awesome games.</strong></p><p>As C# can be used for multiple different areas of programming, I have decided to cover the most important ones. So I have added a whole bunch of chapters specifically designed for a C# developer and Unity game developer - arguably the best Game Engine in the world. In those chapters, you will discover how to create your very own video games by building <strong>pong, the mother of video games, and zig-zag,</strong> an amazing and successful endless runner game.</p><p>We live in a world where knowledge and work are shared more than ever, so using assets provided by others is a huge boost to your progress.&nbsp; You will learn how to use 3D assets to make an endless runner. Then you’ll use animations, reset the game, use particle systems, and finally create a map procedurally. <strong>That’s quite some advanced stuff right there.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I know that learning to code can be hard at times, and sometimes you just get stuck. But no worries, we are there for you. We answer each question as quickly as we can and make sure that you reach your goal of becoming a developer.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>WHO IS THIS COURSE FOR?</strong><br></p><p>The course is for anyone, who wants to learn c# and wants to become professionally good in c# programming. No experience is required whatsoever. It is designed so that anyone who can handle a mouse and keyboard will succeed in finishing it.<strong> The only real requisite is the desire to learn.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;<strong>30-DAY FULL MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE</strong></p><p>This course comes with a 30-day full money-back guarantee. Take the course, watch every lecture, and do the exercises, and if you feel like this course is not for you,&nbsp;ask for a full refund within 30 days.&nbsp;<strong>All your money back, no questions asked</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>ABOUT&nbsp;YOUR&nbsp;INSTRUCTOR:</strong></p><p>My name is Denis Panjuta, and in my courses, I have taught over 350.000 students how to code. I have a Bachelor of Engineering from the University of Applied Sciences in Constance (Germany). I love teaching and creating high-quality courses. My mission is to teach programming to over 10.000.000 people!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>As you see, this is the only C# course you will ever need!</strong></p><p><strong>You will learn all the c# fundamentals, all c# basics, and everything that you need to know to succeed in c# programming and building your own cool video games!&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>So don’t waste any more time and start to make your dreams and ideas come true by taking this course now.</strong></p><p><strong>

This course is focused on efficiency: never spend time on confusing, out of date, incomplete Machine Learning tutorials anymore. <strong>We are pretty confident that this is the most comprehensive and modern course you will find on the subject anywhere (bold statement, we know).</strong></p><p>This comprehensive and<strong> </strong>project based course<strong> will introduce you to all of the modern skills of a Data Scientist and along the way, we will build many real world projects to add to your portfolio. </strong>You will get access to all the code, workbooks and templates (Jupyter Notebooks) on Github, so that you can put them on your portfolio right away! We believe this course solves the biggest challenge to entering the Data Science and Machine Learning field:<strong> having all the necessary resources in one place and learning the latest trends and on the job skills that employers want. </strong></p><p><br>The curriculum is going to be very hands on as we walk you from start to finish of becoming a professional Machine Learning and Data Science engineer.&nbsp;The course covers 2 tracks. If you already know programming, you can dive right in and skip the section where we teach you Python from scratch. If you are completely new, we take you from the very beginning and actually teach you Python and how to use it in the real world for our projects. Don't worry, once we go through the basics like Machine Learning 101 and Python, we then get going into advanced topics like Neural Networks, Deep Learning and Transfer Learning so you can get real life practice and be ready for the real world <strong>(We show you fully fledged Data Science and Machine Learning projects and give you programming Resources and Cheatsheets)!</strong><br><br><strong>The topics covered in this course are:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>- Data Exploration and Visualizations</strong></p><p><strong>- Neural Networks and Deep Learning</strong></p><p><strong>- Model Evaluation and Analysis</strong></p><p><strong>- Python 3</strong></p><p><strong>- Tensorflow 2.0</strong></p><p><strong>- Numpy</strong></p><p><strong>- Scikit-Learn</strong></p><p><strong>- Data Science and Machine Learning Projects and Workflows</strong></p><p><strong>- Data Visualization in Python with MatPlotLib and Seaborn</strong></p><p><strong>- Transfer Learning</strong></p><p><strong>- Image recognition and classification</strong></p><p><strong>- Train/Test and cross validation</strong></p><p><strong>- Supervised Learning: Classification, Regression and Time Series</strong></p><p><strong>- Decision Trees and Random Forests</strong></p><p><strong>- Ensemble Learning</strong></p><p><strong>- Hyperparameter Tuning</strong></p><p><strong>- Using Pandas&nbsp;Data Frames to solve complex tasks</strong></p><p><strong>- Use Pandas&nbsp;to handle CSV Files</strong></p><p><strong>- Deep Learning / Neural Networks with TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras</strong></p><p><strong>-&nbsp;Using Kaggle and entering Machine Learning competitions</strong></p><p><strong>- How to present your findings and impress your boss</strong></p><p><strong>- How to clean and prepare your data for analysis</strong></p><p><strong>- K Nearest Neighbours</strong></p><p><strong>- Support Vector&nbsp;Machines</strong></p><p><strong>- Regression analysis (Linear Regression/Polynomial Regression)</strong></p><p><strong>- How Hadoop, Apache Spark, Kafka, and Apache Flink are used</strong></p><p><strong>- Setting up your environment with Conda, MiniConda, and Jupyter Notebooks</strong></p><p><strong>- Using GPUs with Google Colab</strong></p><p><br></p><p>By the end of this course, you will be a complete Data Scientist that can get hired at large companies. We are going to use everything we learn in the course to <strong>build professional real world projects like Heart Disease Detection, Bulldozer Price Predictor, Dog Breed Image Classifier, and many more</strong>. By the end, you will have a stack of projects you have built that you can show off to others.</p><p><br></p><p>Here’s the truth: Most courses teach you Data&nbsp;Science and do just that. They show you how to get started. But the thing is, you don’t know where to go from there or how to build your own projects. Or they show you a lot of code and complex math on the screen, but they don't really explain things well enough for you to go off on your own and solve real life machine learning problems. </p><p><br></p><p>Whether you are new to programming, or want to level up your Data Science skills, or are coming from a different industry, this course is for you. This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No! <strong>This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner with no Data Science experience, to someone that can go off, forget about Daniel and Andrei, and build their own Data Science and Machine learning workflows. </strong></p><p><br>Machine Learning has applications in Business Marketing and Finance, Healthcare, Cybersecurity, Retail, Transportation and Logistics, Agriculture, Internet of Things, Gaming and Entertainment, Patient Diagnosis, Fraud Detection, Anomaly Detection in Manufacturing, Government, Academia/Research, Recommendation Systems and so much more. The skills learned in this course are going to give you a lot of options for your career. </p><p>You hear statements like Artificial Neural Network, or Artificial Intelligence (AI), and by the end of this course, you will finally understand what these mean!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Click “Enroll Now” and join others in our community to get a leg up in the industry, and learn Data Scientist and Machine Learning.

My articles and videos on machine learning on Medium, personal blog and YouTube have collectively received over 5-million views.</p><p>I love nothing more than a complicated topic explained in an entertaining and educative matter. I know what it's like to try and learn a new topic, online and on your own. So I pour my soul into making sure my creations are accessible as possible.</p><p>My modus operandi (a fancy term for my way of doing things) is learning to create and creating to learn.

An education material&nbsp;should teach real life skills that are current and&nbsp;they should not waste a student's valuable time.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having learned important&nbsp;lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even&nbsp;founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to&nbsp;teaching others valuable&nbsp;software development skills&nbsp;in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.&nbsp;<strong>He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>See you inside the course!</strong></p>";https://www.udemy.com/gift/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/;Learn Data Science, Data Analysis, Machine Learning (Artificial Intelligence) and Python with Tensorflow, Pandas & more!;339;4.6189103;All Levels

The only updates they make are to the title and subtitle.</p><p>Many of the instructors here are also my former students. Do you want to entrust your Salesforce career to someone with minimal experience and makes that their main selling point of their course...how little experience they had when they passed the exam just a year or two ago?</p><p>Don't be fooled. The amount of information and concepts that you need to understand in order to pass the Administrator exam is massive. This course is the most in-depth and complete course you'll find and I encourage you to not settle for a lightweight course that glosses over or entirely skips key concepts that you need to know.</p><p>There are no shortcuts or magic bullets, so don't be fooled by someone selling you a happy/easy path. You are on the correct course right now and here you will learn all that you need and be well thoroughly equipped for the exam.</p><p>I&nbsp;also do not hold down a 'day job' but work daily in the platform to stay up to date and to teach you the latest on the platform. Those with a day job simply don't have the time to devote to keep their courses current and especially don't have the time or interest to go very in-depth. That's why they make the shallowness of their courses the main selling point.</p><p>Also, there is a better way to learn Salesforce now. And that better way is leveraging the power of ChatGPT to deepen and broaden your Salesforce learning and understanding. I&nbsp;am the only Salesforce instructor teaching how to use ChatGPT to prepare for certification exams.</p><p>The reason this is is because ChatGPT makes many certification prep and resume/job sites and services OBSOLETE. </p><p>You can now create your own practice test questions, study guides, flash cards, and even get massive help on your resumes and interview prep, LinkedIn presence and more, for free, with ChatGPT.</p><p>Rather than trying to hide this new reality from you, I&nbsp;am embracing this revolutionary technology to take your learning and potential earning to the next level.</p><p>That is why I&nbsp;recorded a brand new and updated version of this course to leverage the power of ChatGPT to help you prepare for and pass the Salesforce Certified Administrator Exam in record time!</p><p>It would have been much easier for me to leave my well-established, top-selling and top-ranking admin course alone and just update the title and subtitle like other instructors, but I care too much about your success to rest. So I&nbsp;opted to record the additional 225+ videos of close to 20 hours of additional video content to make this course as up to date as possible. </p><p>This course includes a ChatGPT&nbsp;Prompt Library. You can copy and paste all of the prompts I&nbsp;use inside this course into your own free ChatGPT account.</p><p>This ChatGPT&nbsp;Prompt Library will help you to learn the now in-demand skills for Prompt Engineering and Design!</p><p>With the power of ChatGPT you can now do amazing things such as creating apex code to mass update records, create formula fields, validation rules, and so much more.</p><p>You will now find new knowledge area sections in the front of this course where I&nbsp;use ChatGPT to show you how to create Practice Tests, Study Guides, Flashcards and many more study aids.</p><p>I have worked on the Salesforce platform for over a decade. I&nbsp;have helped hundreds of thousands of students attain one or multiple Salesforce certifications.</p><p>I&nbsp;have been teaching on the Udemy platform since 2016 and this is my fourth full revamp of this course. I&nbsp;continually work in the latest Salesforce release to remain current and am constantly updating this course.</p><p>In addition to 500+ in-depth video lessons inside this course, you will also find a&nbsp;Practice Test at the end of this course. It contains 60 questions, and is timed at 90 minutes. You receive Section Level Feedback, just like in the real test. I&nbsp;provide further details and explanations as to why your answers are either correct or incorrect.</p><p><strong>Did you know that Salesforce is&nbsp;the 5th most in-demand IT&nbsp;skill on job postings worldwide? Now is a great time to learn Salesforce and change your career to the cloud.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>This course is constantly updated to be current with the latest release of Salesforce.</strong></p><p><strong><em>""I'm at (Salesforce's)&nbsp;Destination Success right now and your course goes more in-depth than the classroom courses here, and for 1% of the cost!"" - Ben L.</em></strong></p><p><strong>This&nbsp;Salesforce Certification Course and Instructor&nbsp;were&nbsp;recently featured in InfoWorld!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Complete Salesforce Administrator Certification Course is for anyone interested&nbsp;in passing the Administrator Certification exam.

Not to compete for a few dollars an hour on some random freelancing websites.<strong> The goal is to give you the skills of a top designer, and along the way, we are going to design an actual product for a company that you will be able to add to your portfolio.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This course is not about making you just watch along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No! <strong>This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner to someone that is a top Designer that can get hired! Design is a valuable skill that doesn’t get outdated easily like most technical skills. Trends change, but the skills and fundamentals you learn in this course will take you many years into the future. </strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>This course is for you if:</strong><br><em>- You are a complete beginner looking to become a designer and freelance</em></p><p><em>- You are a designer who is looking to charge more for your work</em></p><p><em>- You are a developer who is looking to improve their design skills</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Taught By:<br></strong></p><p>Andrei is the instructor of the <strong>highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing. </strong>His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Tesla, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life.</p><p>Having been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. <strong>Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.</strong> Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.</p><p>Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained. <strong>He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.</strong></p><p>Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.<strong><br><br>--------<br></strong></p><p>Daniel is a design leader in tech with extensive experience in <strong>helping startups build and iterate</strong> on their products. Daniel is passionate about teaching and empowering designers and working with other disciplines to build purposeful products that meet both user and business goals.</p><p>His approach to design is always thoughtful and iterative. Daniel often finds himself working collaboratively with his team whether that is sketching concepts and flows or leading design strategy with team leads and external stakeholders.</p><p>Daniel is a multi faceted designer who’s expertise expands across multiple design disciplines. This includes <strong>User Experience</strong> and <strong>Visual Design</strong>, <strong>User Research</strong>, <strong>Product Strategy</strong>, <strong>Lean and Agile Design Methodologies</strong> and much more. HIs work has helped to shape different solutions for a variety of industries such as housing, blockchain and health.</p><p>When he is not building products, Daniel has spoke and mentored at different meetups and events. He aims to give back to the design community that he has learnt and continues to learn so much from.

Especially in web development (though not limited to that), Docker can really <strong>take you to the next level</strong>!</p><p>With Docker, you create and manage so-called ""<strong>Containers</strong>"" - basically packages of code and tools required to run that code. These containers allow you to run your programs in a<strong> predictable, environment-independent way</strong> - no matter where you need to run it.</p><p>For modern DevOps but also for local development - on your own or in a team - this is a <strong>winner feature</strong> since you will no longer have any ""but it worked on my machine""&nbsp;discussions. It works inside of a container, hence it works everywhere!</p><p><strong>This course will teach you both Docker &amp;&nbsp;Kubernetes from the ground up with all the required theory and tons of examples and demos!</strong></p><p>We'll explore <strong>all key concepts</strong> in detail and <strong>with practical examples and demos</strong> - from images and containers, over volumes and networking all the way up to deployment and Kubernetes Cluster:&nbsp;This course has it all!</p><p><strong>In detail, this course includes the following topics:</strong></p><ul><li><p>A thorough introduction to Docker, containers and why you might want to use Docker</p></li><li><p>Detailed setup instructions for macOS and Windows</p></li><li><p>A deep-dive into the core concepts you need to know:&nbsp;Containers &amp;&nbsp;images</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create custom images, use existing images and how to run containers based on such images</p></li><li><p>Get a detailed overview of the core commands you need when working with Docker</p></li><li><p>Learn how to work with data and how to persist data with volumes</p></li><li><p>Explore container networking - with the outside world and between multiple containers</p></li><li><p>Learn how to work with both single and multi-container projects</p></li><li><p>In-depth deployment instructions:&nbsp;Manual deployment and deployment with managed services like AWS&nbsp;ECS</p></li><li><p>Understand Kubernetes core concepts &amp;&nbsp;architecture</p></li><li><p>Learn how to create Kubernetes resources, deployments, services and how to run your containers with Kubernetes</p></li><li><p>Dive deeply into working with data in Kubernetes projects - with different types of volumes</p></li><li><p>Kubernetes networking and DNS service discovery</p></li><li><p>Learn how to deploy your Kubernetes project (at the example of AWS&nbsp;EKS)</p></li><li><p>And much more!</p></li></ul><p>All these topics are taught in great detail with slides and theory but also, most importantly, with many examples and demo!</p><p>You'll find tons of demo projects throughout the course - using programming languages like NodeJS, Python or PHP&nbsp;(with Laravel).

That itself is a huge gain, which makes your full-stack development process so much easier and faster.</p><p>Plus, popularity and opportunities for Node.js are off the charts.

If you are looking for exam dumps for the SAA-C03 exam, please look somewhere else because this course is definitely NOT for you. </p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>The <strong>AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate</strong> is consistently among the top-paying IT certifications, considering that <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> (AWS) is the leading cloud services platform in the world with almost 50% market share! Earn over $150,000 per year with an AWS Solutions Architect certification!</p><p>But before you become an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional, it is recommended for you to pass the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification exam first, and this is where AWS practice tests come in. It is possible that you have read all of the available AWS documentation online yet still fail the exam! These AWS practice tests simulate the actual certification exam and ensure that you indeed understand the subject matter. </p><p><br></p><p>This <strong>AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C03 ) Practice Exam</strong> course offers the following features:</p><p><br></p><ol><li><p><strong>FULLY&nbsp;UPDATED&nbsp;TO&nbsp;THE&nbsp;&nbsp;SAA-C03 version</strong>-&nbsp; Most practice tests out there are already obsolete and advertised as ""updated"", but in reality, they are not! We have already integrated the new SAA-C03 topics such as Amazon Detective, AWS Global Accelerator, Amazon FSx for Lustre, Amazon EKS&nbsp;Anywhere, AWS&nbsp;Proton, and many more in our sets. The content of this practice test will also be updated to reflect the new SAA-C03 topics.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>390 TOP-NOTCH Questions</strong> - has 6 sets of AWS Practice Tests with 65 UNIQUE questions and a 130-minute time limit for each set.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>SIMULATES ACTUAL EXAM ENVIRONMENT</strong> - mimics the actual and the latest AWS Solutions Architect - Associate SAA-C03 certification exam to help you pass and even ace the AWS exam!</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>DETAILED EXPLANATIONS, REFERENCE LINKS, AND CHEAT SHEETS</strong> - our answer keys at the end of each set have full and detailed explanations along with complete reference links so you can check and verify that the answers are correct.

This prevents the unconscious memorization of the answers and ensures that you fully understand the concepts.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>CLEAR AND ERROR-FREE QUESTIONS</strong> - Each item has reference links to the official AWS&nbsp;Documentation that can validate our provided answer, but you can also post in the QA section so we can discuss any issues.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Prepared by an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional </strong>who has actually passed the actual SAA-C03 exam! (Please see my LinkedIn profile to view my AWS Certificate)</p></li></ol><p>These practice exams are designed to focus on the important exam topics (such as EC2, EBS, S3, and many others) hence, the aforementioned topics have more questions than the other AWS knowledge areas. The number of questions on each topic is carefully selected based on the 4 domains of the actual AWS certification exam.</p><p>Some people are using brain dumps or exam dumps for the <strong>AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate</strong> <strong>SAA-C03 </strong>certification exam, which is totally absurd and highly unprofessional because those exam dumps will hinder you from attaining in-depth AWS knowledge. It can also result in you failing the actual AWS certification exam since Amazon regularly updates the exam coverage.</p><p>Please also note that these <strong>AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate practice tests</strong> <strong>SAA-C03 </strong>are not exam dumps and since Amazon shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with hundreds to thousands of questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the exam is a good understanding of AWS services and this is what our AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C03<strong> </strong>practice tests are meant to do.</p><p>When I was reviewing for my <strong>AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate</strong> exam, I had a hard time finding comprehensive practice tests to help me pass my exam. I bought some of them in the market, but I was disappointed because there were a lot of technical and grammatical errors in the practice questions. This is why I created these AWS practice tests to help my fellow IT professionals in the industry. </p><p>We gave a considerable amount of effort to creating and publishing these AWS practice tests, including the laborious task of checking each item for any errors. We are confident that this will significantly help you pass your SAA-C03 exam. And we don't need to trash or slander other AWS practice test courses here on Udemy just to make a sale because we are confident that our AWS practice tests are simply the <strong>BEST</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong> </p><p>These AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate practice exams for the new SAA-C03 version have a passing score of 72%, but I highly encourage you to repeat taking these exams again and again until you consistently reach a score of 90% or higher on each exam. </p><p>Remember that using this product alone does not guarantee you will pass the AWS exam, as you still need to do your own readings and hands-on exercises in AWS. Nonetheless, these Amazon Web Services practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment of which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score!</p><p>AWS&nbsp;always updates the content of their AWS&nbsp;Certification exam. This is why we regularly update the content of this practice tests reviewer to be on par with the new SAA-C03 version.</p>";https://www.udemy.com/gift/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c03/;Be an AWS Solutions Architect!

AWS Pricing Calculator can provide the estimate of the AWS service usage based on the list of AWS services.</p><p>You should also note AWS is in the process of deprecating a similar tool called the Simple Monthly Calculator. This calculator provides an estimate of usage charges for AWS services based on certain information you provide. It helps customers and prospects estimate their monthly AWS bill more efficiently. </p><p><br></p><p>Incorrect options:</p><p><strong>AWS Cost &amp; Usage Report (AWS CUR)</strong> - The AWS Cost &amp; Usage Report (AWS CUR) contains the most comprehensive set of AWS cost and usage data available, including additional metadata about AWS services, pricing, credit, fees, taxes, discounts, cost categories, Reserved Instances, and Savings Plans. The AWS Cost &amp; Usage Report (AWS CUR) itemizes usage at the account or Organization level by product code, usage type and operation. These costs can be further organized by Cost Allocation tags and Cost Categories. The AWS Cost &amp; Usage Report (AWS CUR) is available at an hourly, daily, or monthly level of granularity, as well as at the management or member account level. The AWS Cost &amp; Usage Report (AWS CUR) cannot provide the estimate of the monthly AWS bill based on the list of AWS services.</p><p><strong>AWS Cost Explorer</strong> - AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report that helps you visualize the costs and usage associated with your top five cost-accruing AWS services, and gives you a detailed breakdown of all services in the table view. The reports let you adjust the time range to view historical data going back up to twelve months to gain an understanding of your cost trends. AWS Cost Explorer cannot provide the estimate of the monthly AWS bill based on the list of AWS services.</p><p><strong>AWS Budgets</strong> - AWS Budgets gives the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. You can also use AWS Budgets to set reservation utilization or coverage targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you define. Budgets can be created at the monthly, quarterly, or yearly level, and you can customize the start and end dates. You can further refine your budget to track costs associated with multiple dimensions, such as AWS service, linked account, tag, and others.&nbsp; AWS Budgets cannot provide the estimate of the monthly AWS bill based on the list of AWS services.</p><p>And reference links to help you learn further!</p><p>=======</p><p><strong>Instructor</strong></p><p>My name is Stéphane Maarek,&nbsp;I am passionate about Cloud Computing, and I will be your instructor in this course.

What this lab essentially is, is a virtual machine that we will use for hacking (Kali Linux) and throughout the course we also create additional virtual *vulnerable* machines that we can practice our attacks on. The reason we use virtual machines is because we are not allowed to test our attacks on real life websites and networks so we create our own environment to do that.</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Downloading Virtual Box &amp; Kali Linux</em></p></li><li><p><em>Creating Our First Virtual Machine</em></p></li><li><p><em>Installing Kali Linux Operating System</em></p></li><li><p><em>5 Stages Of A Penetration Test</em></p></li><li><p>Navigating Through Kali Linux System</p></li><li><p>Creating Files &amp; Managing Directories</p></li><li><p>Network Commands &amp; Sudo Privileges In Kali</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>2.

RECONNAISSANCE&nbsp; - Here we learn what we call Footprinting, or in other words, Information Gathering.</strong> <strong>Once we choose our target, our first task is to gain as much information about the target as possible. </strong></p><ul><li><p><em>What is Information Gathering ?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Obtaining IP Address, Physical Address Using Whois Tool</em></p></li><li><p><em>Whatweb Stealthy Scan</em></p></li><li><p><em>Aggressive Website Technology Discovering on IP Range</em></p></li><li><p><em>Gathering Emails Using theHarvester &amp; Hunterio</em></p></li><li><p><em>How To Download Tools Online</em></p></li><li><p><em>Finding Usernames With Sherlock</em></p></li><li><p><em>Bonus - Email Scraper Tool In Python 3</em></p></li><li><p><em>More About Information Gathering</em></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>4. SCANNING - This is where things get real. In this section, we also gather information but we try to gather only technical information <em>(i.e. if they have open ports, if they have a firewall, what softwares they are running on those open ports, what operating system do they have, is it an outdated operating system, etc.)</em></strong>. </p><ul><li><p><em>Theory Behind Scanning</em></p></li><li><p><em>TCP &amp; UDP</em></p></li><li><p><em>Installing Vulnerable Virtual Machine</em></p></li><li><p><em>Netdiscover</em></p></li><li><p><em>Performing First Nmap Scan</em></p></li><li><p><em>Different Nmap Scan Types</em></p></li><li><p><em>Discovering Target Operating System</em></p></li><li><p><em>Detecting Version Of Service Running On An Open Port</em></p></li><li><p><em>Filtering Port Range &amp; Output Of Scan Results</em></p></li><li><p><em>What is a Firewall/IDS ?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Using Decoys and Packet Fragmentation</em></p></li><li><p><em>Security Evasion Nmap Options</em></p></li><li><p><em>Note: Time To Switch Things Up!</em></p></li><li><p><em>Python Coding Project - Port Scanner</em></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>5. VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS - In this section we use the information that we gathered from scanning <em>(such as softwares that the target has running on open ports)</em> and with this information, we try to determine whether there is any known vulnerabilities. </strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Finding First Vulnerability With Nmap Scripts</em></p></li><li><p><em>Manual Vulnerability Analysis &amp; Searchsploit</em></p></li><li><p><em>Nessus Installation</em></p></li><li><p><em>Discovering Vulnerabilities With Nessus</em></p></li><li><p><em>Scanning Windows 7 Machine With Nessus</em></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>6. EXPLOITATION &amp; GAINING&nbsp;ACCESS&nbsp; </strong>- <strong>This is the exciting part of the course. This is where we attack and gain access to the target machines. Throughout this section, we will be covering many different vulnerabilities and different targets. We perform these attacks on our virtual machines and cover another really important tool for an ethical hacker: Metasploit Framework.</strong> <strong>The goal of exploitation is to get on that target machine. This means we must drop a payload on that target machine so we can use it to navigate through their systems, look through their files, execute anything we want, and delete anything we want without the target knowing anything about it.</strong> <strong>We will also learn to create our own Viruses and Trojans that we can deliver to the target whether through an email or through an USB.</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>What is Exploitation ?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What is a Vulnerability ?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Reverse Shells, Bind Shells ..</em></p></li><li><p><em>Metasploit Framework Structure</em></p></li><li><p><em>Msfconsole Basic Commands</em></p></li><li><p><em>Our First Exploit - vsftp 2.3.4 Exploitation</em></p></li><li><p><em>Misconfigurations Happen - Bindshell Exploitation</em></p></li><li><p><em>Information Disclosure - Telnet Exploit</em></p></li><li><p><em>Software Vulnerability - Samba Exploitation</em></p></li><li><p><em>Attacking SSH - Bruteforce Attack</em></p></li><li><p><em>Exploitation Challenge - 5 Different Exploits</em></p></li><li><p><em>Explaining Windows 7 Setup</em></p></li><li><p><em>Eternal Blue Attack - Windows 7 Exploitation</em></p></li><li><p><em>DoublePulsar Attack - Windows Exploit</em></p></li><li><p><em>BlueKeep Vulnerability - Windows Exploit</em></p></li><li><p><em>Routersploit</em></p></li><li><p><em>Router Default Credentials</em></p></li><li><p><em>Setting Up Vulnerable Windows 10</em></p></li><li><p><em>Crashing Windows 10 Machine Remotely</em></p></li><li><p><em>Exploiting Windows 10 Machine Remotely</em></p></li><li><p>Generating Basic Payload With Msfvenom</p></li><li><p>Advance Msfvenom Usage</p></li><li><p>Generating Powershell Payload Using Veil</p></li><li><p>TheFatRat Payload Creation</p></li><li><p>Hexeditor &amp; Antiviruses</p></li><li><p>Making Our Payload Open An Image</p><p><br></p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>7. POST EXPLOITATION - This is what comes after Exploitation. Post exploitation is what we do on the target machine after we have exploited it. Since we are on that machine we can do many things depending on what we want to get out from it.</strong> <strong>At the end, after we do all of the things we wanted, we want to make sure we cover our tracks by deleting any event logs or deleting any evidence that we were ever on that machine.</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Post Exploitation Theory</em></p></li><li><p><em>Meterpreter Basic Commands</em></p></li><li><p><em>Elevating Privileges With Different Modules</em></p></li><li><p><em>Creating Persistence On The Target System</em></p></li><li><p><em>Post Exploitation Modules</em></p></li><li><p><em>Python Coding Project - Backdoor</em></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>8. WEBSITE PENETRATION TESTING - This is another big topic for an ethical hacker. In this section, we are mainly targeting websites and their bugs/vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be anything from misconfigurations, SQL Injections <em>(us interacting with the database)</em>, Information Disclosures <em>(having access to some information by mistake which shouldn't be out there)</em>, Command Injection (<em>directly interacting with the system through the webpage)</em>, XSS <em>(Cross Site Scripting Attack and Injecting Javascript code on the page)</em></strong>.</p><ul><li><p><em>Website Penetration Testing Theory</em></p></li><li><p><em>HTTP Request &amp; Response</em></p></li><li><p><em>Information Gathering &amp; Dirb Tool</em></p></li><li><p><em>Burpsuite Configuration</em></p></li><li><p><em>ShellShock Exploitation</em></p></li><li><p><em>Command Injection Exploitation</em></p></li><li><p><em>Getting Meterpreter Shell With Command Execution</em></p></li><li><p><em>Reflected XSS &amp; Cookie Stealing</em></p></li><li><p><em>Stored XSS</em></p></li><li><p><em>HTML Injection</em></p></li><li><p><em>SQL Injection</em></p></li><li><p><em>CSRF Vulnerability</em></p></li><li><p><em>Hydra Bruteforce Attack&nbsp; </em></p></li><li><p><em>Burpsuite Intruder</em></p></li><li><p>Python Coding Project - Login Brute-force +&nbsp;Directory Discovery</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>9. MAN IN THE MIDDLE - This is an attack that is used inside a network. This allows us to sniff any unencrypted data and see it in plain text. This could also include seeing passwords in plain text for some websites. There are many tools out there that can perform this attack for us and we cover some of the main ones in the section.</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Theory - Man In The Middle Attack</em></p></li><li><p><em>Bettercap ARP Spoofing</em></p></li><li><p><em>Ettercap Password Sniffing</em></p></li><li><p><em>Manually Poisoning Targets ARP Cache With Scapy</em></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>10. WIFI CRACKING - This is the section where we want to gain access to a network by cracking its wireless password.</strong> </p><ul><li><p><em>Wireless Cracking Theory</em></p></li><li><p><em>Putting Wireless Card In Monitor Mode</em></p></li><li><p><em>Deauthenticating Devices &amp; Grabbing Password</em></p></li><li><p><em>Aircrack Password Cracking</em></p></li><li><p><em>Hashcat Password Cracking</em></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>11. SOCIAL ENGINEERING - This is something we cover in almost every section. Social Engineering is an attack on humans since as we know people are always the weakest security!</strong></p><p>+ much much more!</p><p><br><strong>We guarantee you this is the most comprehensive online course on hacking and security skills! Have a look at the course outline video to see all the topics we are going to cover, all the projects we’re going to build, and all the techniques you’re going to learn to become a top ethical hacker and penetration tester!<br></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Taught By:<br></strong></p><p>Andrei is the instructor of the <strong>highest rated technical courses on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing. </strong>His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Tesla, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life.</p><p><br></p><p>Having been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp. <strong>Programming skills should be affordable and open to all.

Many exist, but they hide the inner workings and challenges of microservices away from you. Instead, we will be using a <strong>minimal number of libraries</strong>, and write as much custom code as possible. This will expose you to challenging problems and clever solutions when handling subjects like async events!</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>What Technology You'll Use</em></strong></p><p>Because we are building a full stack application, we will use a variety of technologies. On the frontend, we'll use <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Next JS</strong> to present content to users. Each service is created using <strong>Node</strong> and <strong>Express</strong>. Data for each service is held in either a <strong>Mongo</strong> database or <strong>Redis</strong>.

People’s perceptions of what energy looks and feels like can be quite different. Empaths understand energy to be beyond the physical realm, but the average individual might think of energy as it pertains to the electrical system of a house. Both perceptions are true, but both have very different implications. If we look at the energy in the wall or that lights up our smartphone, we probably wouldn’t feel a need to cleanse it because our perception is that it is neutral. The energy powering your appliances and devices is neither good nor bad, but when we start to talk about people and their intentions or motives, we begin to label energy in ways that imply it can be polarized.</p><p>In this course, which I consider essential, you will know how the energy in which we live and embrace us behaves and how the practice of energy purification is necessary. This course will teach you about purifying places, environments, objects, and people. Just as in the everyday physical world, it is necessary to clean the places where we live and cleanse ourselves. In the same way, it is essential to do the same work from an energetic point of view.</p><p>This course is essential if you are a holistic practitioner or otherwise operating in the energy field. Anyway, it is beneficial for anyone since it covers topics that most people completely ignore.</p><p><br></p><p>Energy can have a very negative impact on everyday life if we do not know how to behave and if we do not know how to act. This course will teach you techniques to use immediately for yourself or potential customers. It's easy to implement and cheap but of great impact. This system is very simple to learn and also very simple to apply.</p><p><strong>What you’ll learn</strong></p><ul><li><p>You will learn how energy works and the importance of purification.</p></li><li><p>You will be able to apply the techniques of the course to purify places, objects, and people.</p></li><li><p>You will know different ways of purifying and different tools suitable for this purpose</p></li><li><p>You will be able to apply the techniques both on yourself and on your potential customers.</p></li></ul>;https://www.udemy.com/gift/the-ultimate-energy-clearing/;Learn how to cleanse, clear and cut negativity out of your life;525;4.785714;All Levels

5117182;Subscription Business Models for Management Consultants;https://www.udemy.com/course/subscription-business-models-for-management-consultants/;17502;1;3;https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/5117182_ea89.jpg;en_US;"<p><strong>What is the aim of this course?</strong></p><p>More and more firms switch from transaction-based businesses to subscription businesses. This business model requires a different approach when it comes to analyzing it in Excel. During some consulting projects, you may be asked to analyze or model subscription business models in Excel and advise firms on the best course of action. In this course, I will teach how to model fast and efficiently subscription businesses in Excel and how to analyze them during consulting projects.</p><p>In the course you will learn the following things:</p><ol><li><p>How to <strong>model</strong> different<strong> subscription </strong>businesses in<strong> Excel</strong></p></li><li><p>How to <strong>analyze</strong> whether the <strong>switch to a subscription</strong> model makes sense or not</p></li><li><p>How to <strong>analyze customer acquisition</strong></p></li></ol><p>This course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on <strong>Udemy</strong> were already taken by more than <strong>185 000 students</strong> including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez &amp; Marsal, McKinsey, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.</p><p>I teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.</p><p><strong>Why have I decided to create this course?</strong></p><p>Subscription businesses are not the dominant form in most industries. Many people struggle with capturing the complexity of such businesses in Excel. Subscription businesses also require a totally different approach to customer acquisition and retention. Most universities are not addressing this sort of business. Also, some consulting firms don’t provide their consultants with enough opportunities to understand and learn how subscription business work.</p><p>Therefore, I have decided to create this course that will help students <strong>understand or refresh their knowledge </strong>of subscription businesses<strong>.</strong> The course will give you the knowledge and insight into real-life case studies that will make your life during a consulting project much easier. Thanks to this course, you will know what and how to do during consulting projects devoted to subscription businesses. You will master the modeling of subscription businesses in Excel and analyze whether the switch to such a model will make sense. On top of that, you will learn how to approach customer acquisition and retention.</p><p>To sum it up, I believe that if you want to become a world-class Management Consultant or Business Analyst you have to have a pretty decent understanding of subscription businesses. That is why, I highly recommend this course to Management Consultants or Business Analysts, especially those that did not finish business school or Economics. The course will help you become an expert in subscription businesses on the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and other top consulting firms.</p><p><strong>In what way will you benefit from this course?</strong></p><p>The course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you understand, and analyze businesses. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:</p><p>1. How to <strong>model</strong> different<strong> subscription </strong>businesses in<strong> Excel</strong></p><p>2. How to <strong>analyze</strong> whether the <strong>switch to a subscription</strong> model makes sense or not</p><p>3. How to <strong>analyze customer acquisition</strong></p><p>You can also ask me any question either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.</p><p><strong>How the course is organized?</strong></p><p>The course is divided currently into the following sections:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Introduction. </strong>We begin with a little intro to the course as well as some general info on how the course is organized.</p></li><li><p><strong>Essential Concepts. </strong>We will start by explaining some essential concepts that later we will use to describe and show you the differences between subscription businesses. I will explain what we mean by subscription businesses, churn rate, MRR, and MRR churn. I will also provide examples of firms using a subscription model.</p></li><li><p><strong>Modeling Subscription Businesses in Excel. </strong>Modeling Subscription Businesses in Excel requires a bit different approach than transaction-based businesses. We will show you in this section how to do it. I will start with transaction-based e-commerce, after which we will show you how to model e-commerce as a subscription. Later on, we will also model the streaming businesses.</p></li><li><p><strong>SaaS. </strong>A lot of SaaS businesses run as subscription businesses. We will discuss what SaaS is, what KPIs you should pay attention to, and how to model them in Excel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customer Acquisition. </strong>Without customer acquisition, you will not enjoy much growth. In e-commerce, you will spend a lot of time optimizing and finding more optimal ways to acquire customers. In this section, we will discuss how to calculate customer acquisition costs, how to lower them, and how to increase the value of the customer.</p></li></ul><p><strong>You will be able also to download many additional resources</strong></p><p>1. Useful frameworks and techniques</p><p>2. Models &amp; Analyses shown in the course</p><p>3. Additional resources</p><p>4. Links to additional presentations, articles, and movies</p><p>5.

These servers are part of an Auto Scaling Group. 90% of the users start logging into the system at 6 pm every day and continue till midnight. The engineering team at the startup has observed that there is a significant performance lag during the initial hour from 6 pm to 7 pm. The application is able to function normally thereafter.</p><p>As a solutions architect, which of the following steps would you recommend addressing the performance bottleneck during that initial hour of traffic spike?</p><ol><li><p>Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a scheduled action that kicks-off before 6 pm. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm</p></li><li><p>Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a lifecycle hook that kicks-off before 6 pm. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm.</p></li><li><p>Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a target tracking policy. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm.</p></li><li><p>Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a step scaling policy. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm.<br><br></p></li></ol><p><strong>What's your guess? Scroll below for the answer...</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><em>Correct: 1.</em></p><p><em>The scheduled action tells Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to perform a scaling action at specified times. To create a scheduled scaling action, you specify the start time when the scaling action should take effect, and the new minimum, maximum, and desired sizes for the scaling action. The engineering team can create a daily scheduled action to kick-off before 6pm and hence this is the correct option.</em></p><p><em>Auto Scaling group lifecycle hooks enable you to perform custom actions as the Auto Scaling group launches or terminates instances. For example, you could install or configure software on newly launched instances, or download log files from an instance before it terminates. Lifecycle hooks are not the correct choice for this use-case.</em></p><p><em>With target tracking scaling policies, you choose a scaling metric and set a target value. Application Auto Scaling creates and manages the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling policy and calculates the scaling adjustment based on the metric and the target value.</em></p><p><em>With step scaling, you choose scaling metrics and threshold values for the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling process as well as define how your scalable target should be scaled when a threshold is in breach for a specified number of evaluation periods.</em></p><p><em>Both the target tracking as well as step scaling policies entail a lag wherein the instances will be provisioned only when the underlying CloudWatch alarms go off. Therefore we would still see performance lag during some part of the initial hour.</em></p><p>=======</p><p><strong>Instructor</strong></p><p>My name is Stéphane Maarek,&nbsp;I am passionate about Cloud Computing, and I will be your instructor in this course.

This course can be used as a refresher , manual reference to review, understand and use Power BI tools efficiently. Explanations are very clear and crisp. Can help from Beginner to Intermediate level learning</em>.""</p><p>Andrew says: ""<em>I took a similar Power BI course through my work and I think this one is better. Highly recommend this training. I am a Lead ERP Financial Systems Analyst who worked mostly with Oracle BI tools. Company wants to go in a different direction so I am learning Power BI.</em>""</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Do you already use reporting software such as Access, SSRS, Tableau or WebI? Or is this your first reporting software tool? Either way, welcome.</p><p>In this course, learn the skills that Microsoft want you to know, and add another tool to your CV, and even go for the Microsoft Power BI certification.</p><p>Power BI is one of the most requested reporting tools that are requested in the job market, and the ability to being able to use it now could be very useful for your current work, and your next job hunt.</p><p>This course comes in four parts:</p><p><strong>Part 1 - Creating Visualizations (also known as Visualize the Data, and Analyze the Data)</strong></p><p>We'll download and install for free Power BI&nbsp;Desktop. We'll start by creating our first&nbsp;visualizations (vizzes) and investigate the Power BI interface.</p><p>We'll look at the various visualisations available, and go through their common properties. We'll create&nbsp;maps, hierarchies, KPIs, guages, and all sorts of chart types. </p><p><strong>Part 2 - Get and Transform Data (also known as Prepare the Data)</strong></p><p>We see how data can be transformed, saving you time in analysing the data. We'll look at sorting and filtering, split columns, and other transform activities. We'll merge, append and combine queries together. We'll Pivot and Unpivot, and transform text, numbers, dates and times, and create custom columns using the M&nbsp;language.</p><p><strong>Part 3 - Refining the model (also known as Model the Data)</strong></p><p>We'll see how relationships can be made through multiple tables, and refine the data with custom columns and measures using the DAX language.</p><p><strong>Part 4 - Power BI&nbsp;Service</strong></p><p>We'll then publish our visualisations onto the Power BI&nbsp;Service (which you can sign up for free), and then from your reports create dashboards. With the Power BI&nbsp;Pro (for which you can get a free trial), you can also create workspaces and apps.</p><p>The course will take around 27 hours to complete,&nbsp;but completing this will enable you to create vizzes, dashboards and stories&nbsp;of your own, and know how to overcome common problems.</p><p>The course increases in difficulty slowly, so you'll create for instance a table or basic bar chart, then turn it into a stacked bar chart, and investigate more of their properties, step by step.</p><p>The course is fairly relaxed - there will be a few ""wrong turns"", so you can see what problems might arise, but every lesson works towards an end goal at a relatively slow pace, so you can follow on your own computer easily. I assume that you know how to use a computer, including installing programs, but the actual analysis will be at a basic level, and I'll introduce every component as we go on.</p><p>At the end of the course, you can download a certificate of completion, so you can show everyone your new-found skills, and be able to start creating analyses for yourselves.

3570337;The Data Analyst Course: Complete Data Analyst Bootcamp;https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-analyst-course-complete-data-analyst-bootcamp/;63562;1;3;https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/3570337_9b02_6.jpg;en_US;"<p><strong>The problem</strong></p><p>Most data analyst, data science, and coding courses miss a critical practical step. They don’t teach you how to work with raw data, how to clean, and preprocess it. This creates a sizeable gap between the skills you need on the job and the abilities you have acquired in training. Truth be told, real-world data is messy, so you need to know how to overcome this obstacle to become an independent data professional.</p><p>The bootcamps we have seen online and even live classes neglect this aspect and show you how to work with ‘clean’ data. But this isn’t doing you a favour. In reality, it will set you back both when you are applying for jobs, and when you’re on the job.</p><p><strong>The solution</strong></p><p>Our goal is to provide you with complete preparation. And this course will turn you into a job-ready data analyst. To take you there, we will cover the following fundamental topics extensively.</p><ul><li><p>Theory about the field of data analytics</p></li><li><p>Basic Python</p></li><li><p>Advanced Python</p></li><li><p>NumPy</p></li><li><p>Pandas</p></li><li><p>Working with text files</p></li><li><p>Data collection</p></li><li><p>Data cleaning</p></li><li><p>Data preprocessing</p></li><li><p>Data visualization</p></li><li><p>Final practical example</p></li></ul><p>Each of these subjects builds on the previous ones. And this is precisely what makes our curriculum so valuable. Everything is shown in the right order and we guarantee that you are not going to get lost along the way, as we have provided all necessary steps in video (not a single one skipped). In other words, we are not going to teach you how to analyse data before you know how to gather and clean it.</p><p>So, to prepare you for the entry-level job that leads to a data science position - data analyst - we created The Data Analyst Course.</p><p>This is a rather unique training program because it teaches the fundamentals you need on the job. A frequently neglected aspect of vital importance.</p><p>Moreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course provides complete preparation for someone who wants to become a data analyst at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save). We believe that this resource will significantly boost your chances of landing a job, as it will prepare you for practical tasks and concepts that are frequently included in interviews.</p><p><strong>The topics we will cover</strong></p><p>1. Theory about the field of data analytics</p><p>2. Basic Python</p><p>3. Advanced Python</p><p>4. NumPy</p><p>5. Pandas</p><p>6. Working with text files</p><p>7. Data collection</p><p>8. Data cleaning</p><p>9. Data preprocessing</p><p>10. Data visualization</p><p>11. Final practical example</p><p><br></p><p>1. Theory about the field of data analytics</p><p>Here we will focus on the big picture. But don’t imagine long boring pages with terms you’ll have to check up in a dictionary every minute. Instead, this is where we want to define who a data analyst is, what they do, and how they create value for an organization.</p><p>Why learn it?</p><p>You need a general understanding to appreciate how every part of the course fits in with the rest of the content. As they say, if you know where you are going, chances are that you will eventually get there. And since data analyst and other data jobs are relatively new and constantly evolving, we want to provide you with a good grasp of the data analyst role specifically. Then, in the following chapters, we will teach you the actual tools you need to become a data analyst.</p><p>2. Basic Python</p><p>This course is centred around Python. So, we’ll start from the very basics. Don’t be afraid if you do not have prior programming experience.</p><p>Why learn it?</p><p>You need to learn a programming language to take full advantage of the data-rich world we live in. Unless you are equipped with such a skill, you will always be dependent on other people’s ability to extract and manipulate data, and you want to be <em>in</em>dependent while doing analysis, right? Also, you don’t necessarily need to learn many programming languages at once. It is enough to be very skilled at just one, and we’ve naturally chosen Python which has established itself as the number one language for data analysis and data science (thanks to its rich libraries and versatility).</p><p>3. Advanced Python</p><p>We will introduce advanced Python topics such as working with text data and using tools such as list comprehensions and anonymous functions.</p><p>Why learn it?</p><p>These lessons will turn you into a proficient Python user who is independent on the job. You will be able to use Python’s core strengths to your advantage. So, here it is not just about the topics, it is also about the depth in which we explore the most relevant Python tools.</p><p>4. NumPy</p><p>NumPy is Python’s fundamental package for scientific computing. It has established itself as the go-to tool when you need to compute mathematical and statical operations.</p><p>Why learn it?</p><p>A large portion of a data analyst’s work is dedicated to preprocessing datasets. Unquestionably, this involves tons of mathematical and statistical techniques that NumPy is renowned for. In addition, the package introduces multi-dimensional array structures and provides a plethora of built-in functions and methods to use while working with them. In other words, NumPy can be described as a computationally stable state-of-the-art Python instrument that provides flexibility and can take your analysis to the next level.</p><p>5. Pandas</p><p>The pandas library is one of the most popular Python tools that facilitate data manipulation and analysis. It is very valuable because you can use it to manipulate all sorts of information - numerical tables and time series data, as well as text.</p><p>Why learn it?</p><p>Pandas is the other main tool an analyst needs to clean and preprocess the data they are working with. Its data manipulation features are second to none in Python because of the diversity and richness it provides in terms of methods and functions. The combined ability to work with both NumPy and pandas is extremely powerful as the two libraries complement each other. You need to be capable to operate with both to produce a complete and consistent analysis independently.</p><p>6. Working with text files</p><p>Exchanging information with text files is practically how we exchange information today. In this part of the course, we will use the Python, pandas, and NumPy tools learned earlier to give you the essentials you need when importing or saving data.</p><p>Why learn it?</p><p>In many courses, you are just given a dataset to practice your analytical and programming skills. However, we don’t want to close our eyes to reality, where converting a raw dataset from an external file into a workable Python format can be a massive challenge.</p><p>7. Data collection</p><p>In the real world, you don’t always have the data readily available for you. In this part of the course, you will learn how to retrieve data from an API.</p><p>Why learn it?</p><p>You need to know how to source your data, right? To be a well-rounded analyst you must be able to collect data from outside sources. This is rarely a one-click process. This section aims at providing you with all the necessary tools to do that on your own.</p><p>8. Data cleaning</p><p>The next logical step is to clean your data. This is where you will apply the pandas skills acquired earlier in practice. All lessons throughout the course have a real-world perspective.</p><p>Why learn it?</p><p>A large part of a data analyst’s job in the real world involves cleaning data and preparing it for the actual analysis. You can’t expect that you’ll deal with flawless data sources, right? So, it will be up to you to overcome this stage and clean your data.</p><p>9. Data preprocessing</p><p>Even when your dataset is clean and in an understandable shape, it isn’t quite ready to be processed for visualizations and analysis just yet. There is a crucial step in between, and that’s data <em>pre</em>processing.</p><p>Why learn it?</p><p>Data preprocessing is where a data analyst can demonstrate how good or great they are at their job. This stage of the work requires the ability to choose the right statistical tool that will improve the quality of your dataset and the knowledge to implement it with advanced pandas and NumPy techniques. Only when you’ve completed this step can you say that your dataset is preprocessed and ready for the next part, which is data visualization.</p><p>10. Data visualization</p><p>Data visualization is the face of data. Many people look at the data and see nothing. The reason for that is that they are not creating good visualizations. Or even worse – they are creating nice graphs but cannot interpret them accurately.</p><p>Why learn it?</p><p>This part of the course will teach you how to use your data to produce meaningful insights. At the end of the day, data charts are what conveys the most information in the shortest amount of time. And nothing speaks better than a well crafted and meaningful data visualization.</p><p>11. Practical example</p><p>The course contains plenty of exercises and practical cases. In the end, we have included a comprehensive practical example that will show you how everything you have learned along the way comes nicely together. This is where you will be able to appreciate how far you have come in your journey to becoming a data analyst and starting your data career.</p><p><strong>What you get</strong></p><ul><li><p>A program worth $1,250</p></li><li><p>Active Q&amp;A support</p></li><li><p>All the knowledge to become a data analyst</p></li><li><p>A community of aspiring data analysts</p></li><li><p>A certificate of completion</p></li><li><p>Access to frequent future updates</p></li><li><p>Real-world training</p></li><li><p><strong>Get ready to become a data analyst from scratch</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>Why wait?

Do you want to bring OpenAI's API into your application, platform, solution, or business?</p><p><br></p><p>Do you want to build full <strong>real examples applications and solutions with ChatGPT from beginning to end</strong>, including a <strong>Cover Letter Generator, a Travel Itinerary Planner, a PPT Stock Generator, and an app that creates its own replies to email?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Then this is the course for you. <strong>Learn from more than 6 hours of relevant instructional video content</strong>, with the only course that will not just teach you how to use ChatGPT to increase your productivity, but also how to build real-life solutions and applications from scratch using ChatGPT. We will leverage this amazing AI model, along with other OpenAI models like DALL-E, to create business software from beginning to end.</p><p><br></p><p>This course will teach you how to use the <strong>OpenAI's API and integrate it into many different platforms</strong>, including Outlook, Power Apps, Power Automate, Airtable, Bubble, and many more. We will then take what we have learned and build some examples of real-life applications and solutions from scratch.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is this course all about?</strong></p><p>This course has one objective: <strong>start building applications and solutions with ChatGPT</strong>. We do that by first learning more about OpenAI and ChatGPT, and how to use its APIs in our platforms. We then create a serverless function that can take ChatGPT prompts and return responses - the first step to integrate your ChatGPT into your application. After that, we learn to <strong>integrate the ChatGPT API into many platforms, like Outlook, Power Apps, Power Automate, Teams, Bubbe, Airtable, and more. </strong>Finally, we take all we've learned, and <strong>create full applications and solution examples</strong>, like TravelPlan, a web application that helps users create itineraries through the power of ChatGPT.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is OpenAI?</strong></p><p>OpenAI is the company behind ChatGPT - it's an AI research and deployment company that builds amazing AI models and provides them to the public via API for a per-use fee. It is based out of San Francisco and its investors include Microsoft. In fact, Microsoft has recently invested more than $10B into the company.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is ChatGPT?</strong></p><p>GPT-3 is a series of Language Generation models that was developed by OpenAI. <strong>Its newest form, called Davinchi, is what is behind the ChatGPT program that we all know and love.</strong> It grew to popularity in December 2022 after people started using it and seeing how amazing it deals with any Prompt-Response completion questions like ""write me a slogan for an ice cream company"" or ""explain to me Quantum Computing like I'm five years old"".</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is OpenAI's API?</strong></p><p>OpenAI has an API (Application Programming Interface) for all of its GPT-3 models, including ChatGPT and Davinchi. It enables <strong>any platform to talk directly to OpenAI's model</strong>, and this is the tool that lets us program OpenAI into any application or solution that we can think about., like Outlook, Power Apps, and much more.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How do you create business solutions or applications using ChatGPT API?</strong></p><p>We create <strong>applications and solutions by linking ChatGPT's API directly into an application or solution building platform.</strong> For example, we learn how to integrate ChatGPT's API into Power Apps. After we do that, we can build any business application we want using Power Apps and it can now integrate ChatGPT. This is the same case for all the other platforms we cover.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What are the different platforms that we will integrate ChatGPT into?</strong></p><p>We specifically go through Outlook, Teams, Power Automate, Power Apps, Bubble, and Airtable. We also go through how to add ChatGPT as an Azure Function. This enables us to extend ChatGPT to any single platform we want including React, Webflow, Zapier, Excel, and many more.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What applications or solutions will we build in this course?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Tchat</strong> - a Teams chatbot that you can put into your business to answer any question</p></li><li><p><strong>CoverLetterCreator</strong> - a Cover Letter generator based on a job description and reading a set of skills from a Resume</p></li><li><p><strong>TravelPlan</strong> - enables users to create detailed itineraries after specifying a location they are traveling, how long they are going for, and what they want to do</p></li><li><p><strong>StockPhotoPPT</strong> - creates images that users can put into their slide decks with ease</p></li><li><p><strong>PolitelySayNo</strong> - craft emails that politely and professionally say no to tough requests from your manager</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Why learn how to integrate ChatGPT into your solutions and applications</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Improve your productivity</strong> - imagine how easy it would be for ChatGPT to reply to your emails for you, or to create a first draft on your travel itinerary to China. With ChatGPT, you can do that. However, it may be annoying to use the chat feature - so instead why not integrate it directly into the tools you use most like Outlook, Excel, Airtable, and more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build businesses</strong> - many businesses have had AI at their centre. ChatGPT opens the doors for you to create applications and solutions that solve a problem ChatGPT can easily solve. For example, in this course, we create a Cover Letter Generator app that creates cover letters based on a job ad and resume. This can easily be monetized and converted into a successful business.</p></li><li><p><strong>Win with AI</strong> - let’s face it, AI is the future. It is paramount that you include AI in your daily workflows as it can increase your efficiency and improve your output, no matter what job you have.</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p><strong>Why choose this course?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Complete guide</strong> - this is the 100% start to finish, zero to hero, basic to advanced guide on building solutions and applications with ChatGPT.

Learn Unreal Engine 5's new features from <strong>Open World</strong> maps, <strong>Quixel Bridge</strong> megascans for ultra-realistic environments, landscape <strong>sculpting</strong> and <strong>painting</strong>, <strong>dungeons</strong>, free-roaming creatures and humanoids with various <strong>weapons</strong>, <strong>breakable objects</strong> that <strong>spawn treasure</strong>, and more!</p><p>Slay your way through your open world level, hacking and slashing creatures, breaking pots and collecting treasure and souls, and try to keep your health and stamina high! </p><p>We will implement enemy behavior that can be reused for various creature types, including gruntlings, raptors, insects, and golems. Code your character to be able to pick up and equip better and better weapons as she slays stronger and stronger monsters and collects loot.</p><p>We will cover new Unreal Engine 5 features such as <strong>Motion Warping</strong>, <strong>Meta Sounds</strong>, <strong>Linked Anim Graphs</strong>, UE5's new retargeting system with <strong>IK&nbsp;Rigs</strong> and<strong> IK&nbsp;Retargeters</strong>, <strong>Leg IK</strong>&nbsp;with <strong>Control Rigs</strong>, visual effect creation in <strong>Niagara</strong>, and more!</p><p>We'll start with a completely empty level and add everything from sky and atmosphere, nature, trees and plants, and we'll even import an entire dungeon level with the use of UE5's new <strong>Packed Level Instance</strong> feature.</p><p>We will cover <strong>vectors </strong>and game development <strong>mathematics </strong>in a full math section to prepare you for gameplay programming before diving in and creating our first C++&nbsp;class.</p><p>We will then learn Unreal Engine's class hierarchy, creating a basic <strong>Actor</strong>, learning about trigonometry as we use the <strong>sine </strong>function to give our items floating behavior.</p><p>We then create a Bird using the <strong>Pawn </strong>class so we can fly around our level and get a literal bird's-eye view.</p><p>We then create our <strong>Character </strong>class, using <strong>Echo </strong>from the Valley of the Ancient Epic-released free project, a beautiful and lifelike humanoid with <strong>cloth physics</strong> on her scarf and garments.</p><p>We implement <strong>weapon equipping</strong> and <strong>combat</strong>. We learn how to calculate <strong>directional hit reactions</strong>, using <strong>root motion animations</strong> to make our enemies stumble in the correct direction based on the direction of impact.</p><p>We give our enemies <strong>patrolling</strong> behavior, then chasing and <strong>attacking </strong>behavior. We make our enemies smarter with the use of UE5's new <strong>Motion Warping</strong> system, warping our enemy's location and rotation to make it hit the target more frequently, and making it harder to move out of harm's way.</p><p>We then give Echo a fighting chance, by implementing a <strong>dodge </strong>ability, similar to Dark Souls and Elden Ring. She can dodge out of the way while the enemy swings fervently, making them miss so we can move in to counter-attack.</p><p>We make <strong>breakable pots and vases</strong> using the <strong>Chaos destruction system</strong>, and these breakables <strong>spawn treasure</strong> when we break them, allowing us to collect loot and increment our <strong>gold</strong> count in the HUD.</p><p>We create a beautiful Soul effect in <strong>Niagara</strong>, and make enemies <strong>spawn souls</strong> upon death so we can gain <strong>experience points</strong>.</p><p>We learn how to make enemies stronger with an <strong>Attribute </strong>component, giving them varying levels of <strong>health </strong>and <strong>damage</strong>, and <strong>soul spawn counts</strong>.</p><p>We use UE5's new <strong>Animation Blueprint Templates </strong>to reuse all of our enemy code to create different types of enemies, from humanoids that wield weapons to creatures that bite, sting, and smash.</p><p>Get your RPG project started with this amazing course, which is the product of nearly a decade of professional Unreal Engine experience and teaching.</p><p>This course is in a whole new universe than the original UE4 version I created four years ago!&nbsp;Benefit from years of learning, teaching, and implementing Unreal's newly evolved system with its cutting-edge game creation capabilities!</p><p>This is my most well-taught course yet, and by far the most beautiful game project of all my courses on Udemy thus far.</p><p>Join me and let's have a ton of fun creating the start of an action RPG&nbsp;hack-and-slash Open World game in <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong>! </p>";https://www.udemy.com/gift/unreal-engine-5-the-ultimate-game-developer-course/;Learn Unreal Engine 5 C++ Programming by Creating an Action-RPG Style Open World Game!;191;4.7673535;Beginner Level

These sections cover all aspects of Unity Catalog and the implementation using a project. </p><p><em>March 2023</em> - New sections 6 and 7 added. Section 8 Updated. These changes are to reflect latest Databricks recommendations around accessing Azure Data Lake. Also, this provides a better solution to complete the course project for students using Azure Student Subscription or Corporate Subscriptions with limited access to Azure Active Directory. </p><p><em>December 2022</em> - Sections 3, 4 &amp;&nbsp;5 updated to reflect recent UI&nbsp;changes to Azure Databricks.

The primary goal of Six Sigma certification is to validate individuals (like you) who possess the skills to identify variations, defects, or errors in a business process and mitigate or eliminate them. </p><p>The Six Sigma Certification comes in various skill levels:&nbsp;Yellow Belt, Green Belt, Black Belt, and Master Black Belt. These certifications can be obtained through an accreditation body like Advanced Innovation Group Pro Excellence (AIGPE) which trains and certifies professionals in 176+ countries.</p><p>These certifications also help you become a specialist in process improvement and will enhance your career's standard and credibility. </p><p><strong>What is Six Sigma Green Belt Certification?</strong></p><p>Six Sigma Green Belt is a certification course wherein you will receive a hands-on understanding of 100+ tools and techniques. These methods are essential for participating in DMAIC&nbsp;improvement projects. DMAIC&nbsp;stands for Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve, and Control. These are the 5 Phases of a Six Sigma Improvement project. This is the only course that teaches these 5 Phases in 15 structured steps helping you understand the entire methodology in thorough detail. By taking up this certification course, professionals (like you) can identify the problems and implement solutions to eradicate them.</p><p><strong>What are the Benefits of Six Sigma?</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Six Sigma helps your organization reduce variation and eliminate errors</strong></p></li></ul><p>An organization has several business processes. Each business process has its own unique set of procedures followed by individuals working in that business. Acquiring Six Sigma certification enables YOU&nbsp;to become crucial to your organization's ability to identify and eliminate variation and repeatable process errors. </p><p>With a Six Sigma certification, you can help to transform and enable your organization to increase revenue by identifying and eliminating errors that would otherwise have brought poor customer satisfaction and losses to the business. Certified Six Sigma professionals can help reduce variation, errors, customer complaints, cycle time, cost, schedule delays and spending/revenue leakages.</p><p>For example:&nbsp;Between 1986 and 2001, Motorola saved 16 billion dollars using the Six Sigma methodology and General Electric (GE)&nbsp;saved 4.4 billion dollars between 1996 and 1999. </p><ul><li><p><strong>Improve your business and sustain the gains</strong></p></li></ul><p>Once you attain the Six Sigma certification, you'll be able to prove you have the knowledge to identify gaps in an organization's business process and you will be able to measure, analyze and improve those gaps. You will also have the ability to conduct complete review of the current process and gain a very clear understanding of their impact on the output.</p><p>You'll also develop the ability to achieve exceptional improvements in your business and sustain them by monitoring processes closely to ensure there is little or no deviation from the mean and taking corrective measures to improve your implemented actions.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Six Sigma is applicable across industries</strong></p></li></ul><p>What is the value of Six Sigma certification?&nbsp;As an industry independent methodology, Six Sigma techniques are applied in aerospace, electronics, telecom, banking and finance, IT, HR, marketing, and many more industries.</p><p>Getting a Six Sigma certification can lead to better job opportunities and improved salary - even though its not easy to attain. One of the reasons Six Sigma professionals get so much respect is that the practical applications of Six Sigma tools and techniques require creative and out-of-the-box thinking - and executives and hiring managers at major companies are well aware. </p><p>With a Six Sigma certification, you will be able to position yourself as a change agent within the organization, spearheading quality improvement throughout your team or organization, showcasing your leadership skillset. When you get certified in Six Sigma, you become knowledgeable in dozens of different methods to streamline business processes, improve employee acceptance, reduce costs, and increase revenue - all of which lead to better bottom line, no matter the industry. </p><p>As a professional, you need to adapt yourself to the changing demands of your industry. No matter what industry you are a part of, you need to learn to adapt your knowledge to different situations.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ensure Compliance</strong></p></li></ul><p>With the stringent quality standards of Six Sigma, manufacturing and service errors are reduced to less than mediocre figures. This has meant that a number of vendors, procurers, and oversight organizations apply Six Sigma standards when evaluating products or accounts. As a certified Six Sigma professional, you will be able to help your organization comply with international standards, as well as maintain profitable contracts.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Improve Your Managerial and Leadership Ability</strong></p></li></ul><p>Six Sigma training also prepares you for leadership roles, with the techniques and knowhow to cut costs, increase revenue, and ways to improve the efficiency of the business process. Those who achieve Six Sigma Green Belt are not only educated on the methodologies of Six Sigma, they are also prepared to become a change agent within their organization, leading efforts to improve processes and the quality of products and services delivered to customers.</p><p>Once you complete your Six Sigma course and obtain your certification, you will have a clear understanding of measuring and quantifying financial benefits from executing any Six Sigma project. Because financial management and risk assessment are highly desirable skills for middle and top-level management, certified Six Sigma professionals stand a very good chance of rising to senior managerial positions.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Mind-blowing Salary</strong></p></li></ul><p>According to a survey carried out by a well known Salary Analyzing website, the salary for Six Sigma certified individuals routinely break into the $100,000+ pay bracket, and are among the highest-paid professionals globally.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Gain Hands-On Experience In Quality Management</strong></p></li></ul><p>Unlike a few other certifications, the Six Sigma certification process includes hands-on work on industry projects and experience with implementation of theoretical principles to real-life scenarios. As a certified Six Sigma professional, you will gain valuable experience even before you enter the workforce.</p><p>Ready to get started on the path to Six Sigma Green Belt?

Use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to create a private network for resources such as databases, cache instances, or internal services. Connect your lambda function to the VPC to access private resources during execution. When you connect a function to a VPC, Lambda creates an elastic network interface for each combination of the security group and subnet in your function's VPC configuration. This is the right way of giving RDS access to Lambda.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>INCORRECT&nbsp;OPTIONS</strong></p><p><strong>Use Lambda layers to connect to the internet and RDS separately</strong> - You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code and content in the form of layers. A layer is a ZIP archive that contains libraries, a custom runtime, or other dependencies. Layers will not help in configuring access to RDS instance and hence is an incorrect choice.</p><p><strong>Configure lambda to connect to the public subnet that will give internet access and use the Security Group to access RDS inside the private subnet </strong>- This is an incorrect statement. Connecting a Lambda function to a public subnet does not give it internet access or a public IP address. To grant internet access to your function, its associated VPC must have a NAT gateway (or NAT instance) in a public subnet.</p><p><strong>Use Environment variables to pass in the RDS connection string</strong> - You can use environment variables to store secrets securely and adjust your function's behavior without updating code. You can use environment variables to exchange data with RDS, but you will still need access to RDS, which is not possible with just environment variables.</p><p>=======</p><p><strong>Instructor</strong></p><p>My name is Stéphane Maarek,&nbsp;I am passionate about Cloud Computing, and I will be your instructor in this course.

These 6&nbsp;full-length&nbsp;practice exams with 80 questions (including simulation-style questions or PBQs as CompTIA&nbsp;calls them) are timed for 90 minutes to help you pace yourself for the real exam. I have carefully hand-crafted each question to put you to the test and prepare you to pass the certification exam with confidence.</p><p><br>You won't be&nbsp;hoping you are ready, you will know you are ready to sit for and pass the exam. After practicing these tests and scoring an 90% or higher on them, you will be ready to&nbsp;PASS&nbsp;on&nbsp;the first attempt and <strong>avoid costly re-schedule fees</strong>, saving you time and money.<br></p><p>You will receive your total final score, along with feedback on each and every question, telling you exactly why each answer is correct, and which domain (and objective) you need to study more in order to pinpoint the areas in which you need to improve and perform some additional study.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>We cover <strong>all five domains of the SYO-601</strong> exam, including:</p><p>1.0 Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities (24%)</p><p>2.0 Architecture and Design (21%)</p><p>3.0 Implementation (25%)</p><p>4.0 Operations and Incident Response (16%)</p><p>5.0 Governance, Risk, and Compliance (14%)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Our&nbsp;CompTIA&nbsp;Security+&nbsp;(SY0-601)&nbsp;practice exams provide you with realistic test questions&nbsp;and provide you with&nbsp;interactive, question-level feedback.&nbsp;<br></strong></p><p>I have some of the&nbsp;<strong>highest-rated CompTIA training courses on&nbsp;the Udemy platform</strong>&nbsp;and I&nbsp;invite you to visit my instructor profile to learn more about me, the certifications that I hold, and read the reviews of my courses. This course is consistently updated to ensure it stays&nbsp;current and up-to-date&nbsp;with the latest release of the CompTIA&nbsp;Security+&nbsp;exam, and also provide a 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked!<br></p><p><strong>What others are saying about my CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601): Practice Exams with Simulations course: </strong><br><br></p><ul><li><p>These questions are unique and well-conducted to prepare for security+ with relevant information. I am using multiple resources and this is definitely one to have. (Valdrin, 5 stars)<br></p></li><li><p>I passed and these practice tests were a very important tool in my success. The details: the questions in these practice tests require very careful reading. For me, that was key as the actual exam's questions were more concise, so I felt well-prepared. To use these practice exams effectively (at least for me), I recommend taking the first one, determine what areas are the weak and emphasize your study in those areas for a number of days. Then take the next test and see what progress - or lack of - and then the study again. Repeat this until you complete all six. Then start the process again. If you have hit your study targets consistently, you should be able to get to 90% and above on the next or subsequent round of sample exams. I found that I was easily getting above 90% on my last week of studying before my exam. I did find the simulated questions to be inadequate, however. You may need to find an additional source for performance-based questions to supplement what you are learning here with the multiple choice questions. Don't overlook the PBQs! They were a challenge on the exam but I prepared well outside of Dion's tests and I think that's what allowed me to pass (honestly, who knows; there isn't any detailed feedback when the results are displayed and I don't know how much the PBQs are weighted in the total point calculation). Good luck! (Edward Valizan, 5 stars)</p></li><li><p>Another quality piece from Jason Dion. Honestly, if you want to pass any CompTIA exams, just buy Jason's practice exams. I have just bought the CySA+ practice exams, I am sure I will pass for the first time. Edit: I see a lot of people are complaining that it is not like the real exam questions and it does not cover all the topics. Of course you use other training materials too. I have read the Chaplle-Seidl book by Sybex. I have done all the online tests included with the book. I had the official CompTIA notes as well. I have watched a full video course from a wrong source it was so boring and dry, it was just a waste of my time. All in all, to me these tests covered all the topics I did not cover from the other materials, they are difficult but similarly worded than the exam, so your brain is trained for the real exam. I did not have time to go thorugh them 3 times so I have never done 90% on any of them, still passed the Sec+ exam easy. Anyways if you want to go down that route and want the real exam questions; exam dumps are readily available for free after some googling. Unfortunately, I don't see the point of that.&nbsp; (Gabe Laszlo, 5 stars)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p></li></ul>";https://www.udemy.com/gift/security-601-exams/;Full-length CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601) Practice Exams * Simulated PBQs * Timed * 480 Questions with feedback!;74;4.5186853;All Levels

5189812;Essential Process Mapping for Management Consultants;https://www.udemy.com/course/essential-process-mapping-for-management-consultants/;17502;1;4;https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/5189812_08b4.jpg;en_US;"<p><strong>What is the aim of this course?</strong></p><p>During many consulting projects, you will have to map business processes. This will help you improve or change the existing processes. There are many ways in which you can do that. Not all of them will be understood by the customer, who will be using the processes in practice. Therefore, I will teach how to map business processes in practice using different methods. You will also learn which method to use in a specific situation.</p><p>In the course you will learn the following things:</p><ul><li><p>How to <strong>map processes</strong> using <strong>different methods</strong> (essential concepts)</p></li><li><p>How to <strong>decide which way</strong> of process mapping is <strong>optimal</strong> for your customer</p></li><li><p>What <strong>tools</strong> to use for <strong>process mapping</strong></p></li></ul><p>This course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on <strong>Udemy</strong> were already taken by more than <strong>182 000 students</strong> including people working in EY, McKinsey, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez &amp; Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.</p><p>I teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excel files as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.</p><p><strong>Why have I decided to create this course?</strong></p><p>During many consulting projects, you have to understand, map and present key processes. After optimizing those processes, you will also have to create manuals presenting new processes. To do that efficiently you have to master the <strong>essential techniques used in process mapping</strong>. Most firms don’t give you the full toolbox that you need. This may lead to huge frustration during consulting projects and a lot of inefficiencies.</p><p>Therefore, I have decided to create this course that will help students <strong>understand or refresh the main skills and tools </strong>that they need to <strong>map processes efficiently.</strong> The course will give you the knowledge and insight into real-life case studies that will make your life during a consulting project much easier. Thanks to this course, you will know how to ma processes and what technique is the right one.</p><p>To sum it up, I believe that if you want to become a world-class Management Consultant or Business Analyst you have to have a pretty decent understanding of process mapping. That is why I highly recommend this course to Management Consultants or Business Analysts. The course will help you become an expert in process mapping on the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and other top consulting firms.</p><p><strong>In what way will you benefit from this course?</strong></p><p>The course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you understand, and analyze businesses. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:</p><ul><li><p>How to <strong>map processes</strong> using <strong>different methods</strong> (essential concepts)</p></li><li><p>How to <strong>decide which way</strong> of process mapping is <strong>optimal</strong> for your customer</p></li><li><p>What <strong>tools</strong> to use for <strong>process mapping</strong></p></li></ul><p>You can also ask me any question either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.</p><p><strong>How is the course organized?</strong></p><p>The course is divided currently into the following sections:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Introduction. </strong>We begin with a little introduction to the course as well as some general info on how the course is organized</p></li><li><p><strong>How to Map Business Processes</strong>. There are many different ways to map business processes. In this section, we will show you how to use the most popular ones in practice. We will discuss flowcharts, BPMN, descriptive mapping, Gantt Charts, and RACI.</p></li><li><p><strong>Case Study in Business Process Mapping. In this section, </strong>we will map processes in a firm that is producing educational content and courses.

In this section, we will discuss the selected one that you can find useful when doing process mapping.</p></li><li><p><strong>Which method to choose</strong>? There are plenty of methods to map processes. Not all of them will be a good idea. In this section, we will see how to pick the optimal method for a specific situation.</p></li></ul><p><strong>You will be able also to download many additional resources</strong></p><p>1.

5254164;IP Services HSRP, VRRP & GLBP;https://www.udemy.com/course/ip-services-hsrp-vrrp-glbp/;17502;1;5;https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/5254164_078c.jpg;en_US;<p><strong>First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP)</strong></p><p>IP routing redundancy is designed to allow for transparent fail-over at the first-hop IP router.</p><p>Both HSRP and VRRP enable two or more devices to work together in a group, sharing a single IP address, the virtual IP address. The virtual IP address is configured in each end user's workstation as a default gateway address and is cached in the host's Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache.</p><p>In an HSRP or VRRP group, one router is elected to handle all requests sent to the virtual IP address. With HSRP, this is the active router. An HSRP group has one active router, at least one standby router, and perhaps many listening routers. A VRRP group has one active router and one or more backup routers.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>HSRP protocol:</strong></p><p>Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) is a Cisco proprietary protocol that allows two or more routers to work together to present the appearance of a single virtual router to the hosts on a LAN. HSRP provides redundancy, load balancing, and automatic failover in case of a router failure.</p><p>In HSRP, one router is elected as the active router, and another router is elected as the standby router. The active router is responsible for forwarding packets sent to the virtual IP address, and the standby router monitors the active router and takes over the forwarding role if the active router fails. The virtual IP address is assigned to the active router, and it responds to ARP requests for that IP address.</p><p>HSRP also supports the concept of a preemption, which means that if a higher priority router becomes available on the network, it can preempt the current active router and become the new active router. HSRP also supports load balancing by allowing multiple routers to share the forwarding of packets sent to the virtual IP address.</p><p>HSRP is commonly used in enterprise networks, especially in mission-critical environments, to provide redundancy and ensure high availability of network services.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>VRRP protocol:</strong></p><p>Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) is a standards-based protocol that provides redundancy and failover capabilities for IP networks. Like HSRP, VRRP allows multiple routers to work together to present the appearance of a single virtual router to hosts on a LAN. However, unlike HSRP, VRRP is not vendor-specific and can be used on a variety of network devices from different manufacturers.</p><p>In VRRP, the routers that participate in the protocol elect one router as the master router and the other routers as backup routers. The master router is responsible for forwarding packets sent to the virtual IP address, and the backup routers monitor the master router and take over the forwarding role if the master router fails. The virtual IP address is assigned to the master router, and it responds to ARP requests for that IP address.</p><p>VRRP also supports the concept of a preemptive router, which means that if a higher priority router becomes available on the network, it can preempt the current master router and become the new master router. Additionally, VRRP supports load balancing by allowing multiple routers to share the forwarding of packets sent to the virtual IP address.</p><p>VRRP is commonly used in enterprise networks, especially in mission-critical environments, to provide redundancy and ensure high availability of network services.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>GLBP proptocol:</strong></p><p>Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) is a Cisco proprietary protocol that provides redundancy and load balancing capabilities for IP networks. GLBP allows multiple routers to work together to present the appearance of a single virtual gateway IP address to hosts on a LAN, while also distributing the traffic load across multiple routers.</p><p>In GLBP, the routers that participate in the protocol elect one router as the active virtual forwarder (AVF) and the other routers as backup virtual forwarders (BVF). The AVF is responsible for forwarding packets sent to the virtual IP address, and the BVFs share the forwarding load by forwarding packets for virtual MAC addresses assigned by the AVF. The virtual IP address and virtual MAC addresses are assigned to the AVF, and it responds to ARP requests for those addresses.</p><p>GLBP also supports the concept of a preemptive router, which means that if a higher priority router becomes available on the network, it can preempt the current AVF and become the new AVF. Additionally, GLBP allows for load balancing by using a variety of load-balancing algorithms, including round-robin, weighted, and host-dependent.</p><p>GLBP is commonly used in enterprise networks, especially in environments where there is high demand for network services and redundancy is crucial. GLBP can help optimize network performance and reduce the risk of service disruptions by distributing traffic load across multiple routers while providing redundancy and failover capabilities.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Table of content:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Introduction</p></li><li><p>IP Services Overview</p></li><li><p>Overview of HSRP, VRRP and GLBP</p></li><li><p>HSRP Lab</p></li><li><p>Configuring HSRP Tracking</p></li><li><p>Load Sharing with HSRP</p></li><li><p>Implementing VRRP</p></li><li><p>Implementing GLBP</p></li></ol>;https://www.udemy.com/gift/ip-services-hsrp-vrrp-glbp/;Implementing First Hop Redundancy Protocol (HSRP, VRRP & GLBP);1414;4.642857;Beginner Level

Proficiency in Autodesk Revit: </strong>You will develop a strong understanding of the software's interface, tools, and functionalities, enabling you to efficiently navigate and utilize Revit for various architectural, engineering, and construction projects.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Building Information Modeling (BIM) expertise: </strong>The course will equip you with comprehensive knowledge of BIM principles and practices using Autodesk Revit.

We have a lot of pure players, but also traditional businesses build their own e-commerce business units. Consulting firms are quite often hired to help analyze and improve e-commerce businesses. Those projects are interesting yet challenging. Luckily, there are a lot of interesting techniques and frameworks that will help you analyze and model e-commerce during consulting projects. In this course, I will teach how to perform fast and efficiently different types of analyses related to e-commerce.</p><p>In the course, you will learn the following things:</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>drivers of the e-commerce</strong> business model</p></li><li><p>Conduct <strong>analyses of e-commerce</strong> in Excel during consulting projects</p></li><li><p>How to <strong>model e-commerce business</strong> in Excel</p></li><li><p>How to <strong>analyze potential improvements</strong> in e-commerce</p></li><li><p>How to <strong>model marketplaces</strong></p></li><li><p>How to do <strong>funnel analysis</strong> in e-commerce</p></li><li><p>How to measure and <strong>lower </strong>the <strong>costs of acquiring customers (CAC)</strong></p></li><li><p>How to measure and <strong>increase </strong>the L<strong>ifetime Value of the Customer (LTV)</strong></p></li></ul><p>This course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on <strong>Udemy</strong> were already taken by more than <strong>181 000 students</strong> including people working in EY, McKinsey, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez &amp; Marsal, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others.</p><p>I teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures. Therefore, as a part of this course, you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work.</p><p><strong>Why have I decided to create this course?</strong></p><p>E-commerce has become an important business unit for the majority of Retailers and Consumer Brands (especially FMCG and SMCG). It behaves differently than traditional businesses and you have to adjust your approach to the new situation. Most firms don’t give you the full toolbox that you need. This may lead to huge frustration during consulting projects and a lot of inefficiencies.</p><p>Therefore, I have decided to create this course that will help students <strong>understand or refresh the main skills and tools </strong>that they will need during <strong>consulting projects devoted to e-commerce.</strong> The course will give you the knowledge and insight into real-life case studies that will make your life during a consulting project much easier. Thanks to this course, you will know what and how to do during consulting projects devoted to e-commerce. You will master how to analyze data and draw conclusions from the analyses.</p><p>To sum it up, I believe that if you want to become a world-class Management Consultant or Business Analyst you have to have a pretty decent understanding of the e-commerce business model. That is why, I highly recommend this course to Management Consultants or Business Analysts, especially those that did not finish business school. The course will help you become an expert in e-commerce on the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and other top consulting firms.</p><p><strong>In what way will you benefit from this course?</strong></p><p>The course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you understand, and analyze businesses. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn:</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>drivers of the e-commerce</strong> business model</p></li><li><p>Conduct <strong>analyses of e-commerce</strong> in Excel during consulting projects</p></li><li><p>How to <strong>model e-commerce business</strong> in Excel</p></li><li><p>How to <strong>analyze potential improvements</strong> in e-commerce</p></li><li><p>How to <strong>model marketplaces</strong></p></li><li><p>How to do <strong>funnel analysis</strong> in e-commerce</p></li></ul><p>You can also ask me any question either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly.</p><p><strong>How is the course organized?</strong></p><p>The course is divided currently into the following sections:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Introduction. </strong>We begin with a little introduction to the course as well as some general info on how the course is organized</p></li><li><p><strong>Essential Concepts.</strong> We will start with some essential concepts around e-commerce. This will help us later on with more advanced issues. We will also see how to create a basic e-commerce model in Excel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Modeling Cash Flow in e-commerce</strong>. In the previous section, we showed you how to do a simple business model in Excel for e-commerce. In this section, we will concentrate on modeling the Cash Flow in a simple way.</p></li><li><p><strong>Funnel Analysis.</strong> Funnel Analysis can be used to map and analyze a series of events that lead to a particular goal. In this section, we will discuss what is a funnel analysis and how you can use it to achieve better business results.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sales Funnels by Cohorts</strong>. Quite often you want to go deeper and analyze how the sales funnel looks like for different segments, and cohorts. This is when cohort analysis comes in handy. We will discuss it in this section.</p></li><li><p><strong>Advanced model of e-commerce.</strong> In some cases, you will have to create more complex models of e-commerce. In this section, we will see how this can be done in practice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customer Acquisition.</strong> Without customer acquisition, you will not enjoy much growth. In e-commerce, you will spend a lot of time on optimizing and finding more optimal ways to acquire customers. In this section, you will learn how to analyze and optimize customer acquisition.</p></li><li><p><strong>2-sided market</strong>. Many e-commerce businesses will try to expand their business by becoming a marketplace, which is a type of 2-sided market. We will discuss it in this section.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multichannel.</strong> In this section, we will discuss the so-called multichannel and I will show you the main challenges in this concept</p></li></ul><p><strong>You will be able also to download many additional resources</strong></p><p>Useful frameworks and techniques</p><p>Analyses showed in the course</p><p>Additional resources</p><p>Links to additional presentations, articles, and movies</p><p>Links to books worth reading</p><p><strong>At the end of my course, students will learn:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The <strong>drivers of the e-commerce</strong> business model</p></li><li><p>Conduct <strong>analyses of e-commerce</strong> in Excel during consulting projects</p></li><li><p>How to <strong>model e-commerce business</strong> in Excel</p></li><li><p>How to <strong>analyze potential improvements</strong> in e-commerce</p></li><li><p>How to <strong>model marketplaces</strong></p></li><li><p>How to do <strong>funnel analysis</strong> in e-commerce</p></li></ul><p><strong>Who should take this course?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Management Consultants</p></li><li><p>Business Analysts</p></li><li><p>Managers</p></li><li><p>Financial Controllers</p></li><li><p>Investment Analysts</p></li><li><p>Startup Founders</p></li></ul><p><strong>What will students need to know or do before starting this course?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Basic or intermediate Excel</p></li><li><p>Basic knowledge of economics</p></li><li><p>Basic or intermediate knowledge of finance &amp; accounting</p></li></ul>";https://www.udemy.com/gift/e-commerce-for-management-consultants-business-analysts/;A practical guide on how to model, analyze and improve e-commerce businesses;558;4.6484375;All Levels

In this course I am going to help you draw the face really believably in the style you choose and apply it to your career or personal visions. You will be able to do it quickly with purpose in a way that is clear and carries meaning to your viewers.

He's not simply some guy who's always liked to draw, got a microphone for Christmas and thought it'd be cool to make a course. I regard myself as an exceptionally unexceptional draftsman but can already sense some improvement in the way I'm tackling portraits.The value I've already received leaves me with absolutely no complaints. You'll be getting A LOT of information from a guy who knows what he's doing with this course. And the demos - from blank sheet of paper to finished, fully rendered drawing - are both highly informative and inspirational. I'm not sure you can ask for more than that from any instructor. It's a keeper. Many Thanks, Mr P for putting this together.</p><p>–Sam Pollard<br></p><p>Of all the elements of drawing, portraiture is one of the most difficult to master. Practice alone is not enough to create portraits that come alive. That is the core value of this course. It provides a strong foundation for the individual to begin to master the creation of portraits of substance. This is not a course for the lazy. It requires patience and practice. But it will provide a roadmap that will allow the student to create fulfilling and satisfying portraits.</p><p>–Stuart Givot</p><p>An Excellent Course. I was Impressed by Chris's Level of Knowledge, Experience and Expertise. This course has differently give me knowledge that will help me improve my work and help me integrate into work with Charcoal.</p><p>–Aisha Smith</p><p>I was blown away of how great of a teacher Mr. Petrocchi is. He provided some incredible insights into helping me improve my facial drawing skills. It's amazing of how easy and simple he teaches technique. I feel inspired and highly recommend his courses. I can't wait to learn more from him!!!</p><p>–Tuese Ahkiong</p><p>Here is a clear, deep and well made course. Chris's sense of art teaching is excellent, it's like hanging out in his studio, looking over his shoulder (literally sometimes) and learning from following a professional. He talks out loud what goes on in his thoughts as he mindfully works his image. Seeing him work really helps me. His own career is used as an example, and I love all the personal stories that talk about his journey in the art world and specifically in this field of drawing portraits. The course is full of gold nuggets of info, stories, metaphors that help me put words and structure in my work. (I love the ""Valley of the Suck""<strong> </strong>concept–so true! ) This course really helped me to clarify my work in regards to values. Also, it helps to come back to those foundations of the underlying structure of the face. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to build a strong foundation and seriously wants to get into portrait art. As it is in my case, I would recommend it as well to any professional that wants to come back and touch those foundations again, one tends to forget stuff! Thank you Chris, and I agree ""the figure is a song""!</p><p>–Philippe Ames<br></p><p>If you are ready to improve and go higher than you ever thought you could with your portraits then this course is for you!</p><p>See you inside,</p><p>Chris Petrocchi | Draw Juice studio</p><p>#portrait #portraiture #drawing #draw #human #faces #beginners #pencil #charcoal</p>";https://www.udemy.com/gift/master-portrait-drawing/;How To Draw Human Faces : Realistic Portrait Drawing : Beginners Portraiture Step by Step : How To Draw Portraits : Art;2005;4.5102043;All Levels

Sadly, I must say that I purchased this course when it was on sale, but it would definitely be worth the full price as this course is amazing. I will admit that I was one of those idiots that purchased expensive courses for learning Amazon FBA. Other than a few courses on Udemy I also purchased a course at $400 and purchased a mentorship at $1,350 and then purchased another course on Amazon and Ranking that was $5,000. The funny thing is, is that I keep coming back to this course to learn. This course far surpasses the value of the other courses I had purchased and it was not even 1/4th the price.” </em><strong>- Eric N</strong></p><p><br></p><p><em>“It is kind of hard to describe the quantity of information Sumner communicates in this course. It's a long course (19.5hrs). During the whole time Sumner is fresh, prepared and he clearly explains all topics. And I mean ALL topics. He covers all areas of Amazon FBA but then goes further with pointers to other aspects of e-commerce which you can explore. I have an amazing number of new bookmarks pointing to critical tools in my browser and a huge number of bookmarks within the course. The bookmarks within the course will be my guideposts to go back and review topics as they come up in my business, which I'm sure they will. If you are going to do Amazon FBA take this course. It will take you a while to go through it but you will thank the e-commerce spirits for guiding you to it. Best of luck and Here's to a prosperous year.

This is a nuts and bolts, no-nonsense course, filled with loads of relevant and insightful content. The instructor provides not only the basics, but goes above and beyond in offering tips, tricks, and loads of professional advice on the marketing side of the business (I believe his university focus was on marketing--so this is a pleasant surprise). I believe Sumner found a gap in this AMZ seller education market, and has filled the niche nicely with top-notch course material, great referrals, and attentive responses to student questions. I took the course at a steep discount, however easily worth the full $200 value.” <strong>- Cory T</strong></p><p><br></p><p><em>""Life changing"" indeed as the instructor promised at the beginning.

His lessons are great for me so far because they are detailed, and he explains every step of the process. I actually appreciate that he speaks fast so that we can get through each lesson quickly.

What's the secret? Make it easy. I realised that the most effective way to make any weight loss diet sustainable and to prevent myself from going off track or reversing progress was to make the diet as easy as possible. To do this I focused on high-volume low-calorie density foods. I found that the most delicious and healthiest way to do this was to focus on low carb plant foods.</p><p><br></p><p>My core learning that help me crack the code was to focus on the types of food rather than the amount. In fact, I’m not only did not limit the volume and amount of food I ate but I actually made a point of aiming to increase the volume of food I ate. My reason for this was that eating high volumes of the right foods decreases the likelihood that one feels the need to eat foods on does not want to eat, makes it easiest to stick to the diet sustainably and improves the life experience on hairs while making progress towards weight loss.</p><p>Furthermore, I learned the importance of focusing on the habit rather than the number on the scale.</p><p><br></p>;https://www.udemy.com/gift/weight-loss-diary/;See a sustained account of which food volumes and which food types,  can result in how much weight loss.;2655;5.0;All Levels

You won't just be staring at your screen. We'll leave that for other PyTorch tutorials and courses.</p><p>In this course you'll actually be:</p><ul><li><p>Running experiments</p></li><li><p>Completing exercises to test your skills</p></li><li><p>Building real-world deep learning models and projects to mimic real life scenarios</p></li></ul><p>By the end of it all, you'll have the skillset needed to identify and develop modern deep learning solutions that Big Tech companies encounter.</p><p><strong>⚠ Fair warning:</strong> this course is <em>very comprehensive</em>. But don't be intimidated, Daniel will teach you everything from scratch and step-by-step!</p><p><strong>Here's what you'll learn in this PyTorch course:</strong></p><p><strong>1. PyTorch Fundamentals</strong> — We start with the barebone fundamentals, so even if you're a beginner you'll get up to speed.</p><p>In machine learning, data gets represented as a tensor (a collection of numbers). Learning how to craft tensors with PyTorch is paramount to building machine learning algorithms. In PyTorch Fundamentals we cover the PyTorch tensor datatype in-depth.</p><p><strong>2. PyTorch Workflow</strong> — Okay, you’ve got the fundamentals down, and you've made some tensors to represent data, but what now?</p><p>With PyTorch Workflow you’ll learn the steps to go from data -&gt; tensors -&gt; trained neural network model. You’ll see and use these steps wherever you encounter PyTorch code as well as for the rest of the course.</p><p><strong>3. PyTorch Neural Network Classification</strong> — Classification is one of the most common machine learning problems.</p><ul><li><p>Is something one thing or another?</p></li><li><p>Is an email spam or not spam?</p></li><li><p>Is credit card transaction fraud or not fraud?</p></li></ul><p>With PyTorch Neural Network Classification you’ll learn how to code a neural network classification model using PyTorch so that you can classify things and answer these questions.</p><p><strong>4. PyTorch Computer Vision</strong> — Neural networks have changed the game of computer vision forever. And now PyTorch drives many of the latest advancements in computer vision algorithms.</p><p>For example, Tesla use PyTorch to build the computer vision algorithms for their self-driving software.</p><p>With PyTorch Computer Vision you’ll build a PyTorch neural network capable of seeing patterns in images of and classifying them into different categories.</p><p><strong>5. PyTorch Custom Datasets</strong> — The magic of machine learning is building algorithms to find patterns in your own custom data. There are plenty of existing datasets out there, but how do you load your own custom dataset into PyTorch?</p><p>This is exactly what you'll learn with the PyTorch Custom Datasets section of this course.</p><p>You’ll learn how to load an image dataset for FoodVision Mini: a PyTorch computer vision model capable of classifying images of pizza, steak and sushi (am I making you <em>hungry</em> to learn yet?!).</p><p>We’ll be building upon FoodVision Mini for the rest of the course.</p><p><strong>6. PyTorch Going Modular</strong> — The whole point of PyTorch is to be able to write Pythonic machine learning code.</p><p>There are two main tools for writing machine learning code with Python:</p><ol><li><p>A Jupyter/Google Colab notebook (great for experimenting)</p></li><li><p>Python scripts (great for reproducibility and modularity)</p></li></ol><p>In the PyTorch Going Modular section of this course, you’ll learn how to take your most useful Jupyter/Google Colab Notebook code and turn it reusable Python scripts. This is often how you’ll find PyTorch code shared in the wild.</p><p><strong>7. PyTorch Transfer Learning</strong> — What if you could take what one model has learned and leverage it for your own problems? That’s what PyTorch Transfer Learning covers.</p><p>You’ll learn about the power of transfer learning and how it enables you to take a machine learning model trained on millions of images, modify it slightly, and enhance the performance of FoodVision Mini, saving you time and resources.</p><p><strong>8. PyTorch Experiment Tracking</strong> — Now we're going to start cooking with <em>heat</em> by starting Part 1 of our Milestone Project of the course!</p><p>At this point you’ll have built plenty of PyTorch models. But how do you keep track of which model performs the best?</p><p>That’s where PyTorch Experiment Tracking comes in.</p><p>Following the machine learning practitioner’s motto of <em>experiment, experiment, experiment!</em> you’ll setup a system to keep track of various FoodVision Mini experiment results and then compare them to find the best.</p><p><strong>9. PyTorch Paper Replicating</strong> — The field of machine learning advances quickly. New research papers get published every day. Being able to read and understand these papers takes time and practice.</p><p>So that’s what PyTorch Paper Replicating covers. You’ll learn how to go through a machine learning research paper and replicate it with PyTorch code.</p><p>At this point you'll also undertake Part 2 of our Milestone Project, where you’ll replicate the groundbreaking Vision Transformer architecture!</p><p><strong>10. PyTorch Model Deployment</strong> — By this stage your FoodVision model will be performing quite well. But up until now, you’ve been the only one with access to it.</p><p>How do you get your PyTorch models in the hands of others?</p><p>That’s what PyTorch Model Deployment covers. In Part 3 of your Milestone Project, you’ll learn how to take the best performing FoodVision Mini model and deploy it to the web so other people can access it and try it out with their own food images.</p><p><strong>What's the bottom line?</strong></p><p>Machine learning's growth and adoption is exploding, and deep learning is how you take your machine learning knowledge to the next level. More and more job openings are looking for this specialized knowledge.</p><p>Companies like Tesla, Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta (Facebook + Instagram), Airbnb and many others are currently powered by PyTorch.</p><p>And this is the most comprehensive online bootcamp to learn PyTorch and kickstart your career as a Deep Learning Engineer.</p><p><strong>So why wait?

5232062;Make Title FX in Adobe Premiere Pro;https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-make-cool-title-fx-in-premiere-pro/;17502;1;8;https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/480x270/5232062_cdca_7.jpg;en_US;"<p>12 Different Lessons on what you can to make your titles more engaging.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What we will do in these lessons:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>1.&nbsp; PLACE TITLES BEHIND SUBJECT - Now this lesson makes more sense and is definitely something we are seeing a lot of. Use masking to cut away the video and place the title in between the top layer and bottom layer, and then add motion to the title to make it appear as it is behind the subject in the video.</p><p><br></p><p>2. STRANGER THINGS - Overall, this may not be something you'll want to do, as it did take me several hours. BUT ... Check out something crazy like how to replicate Stranger Things and see all that went into making those titles shake and illuminate and even glow with a bright hot orange.&nbsp; This is highly complicated, but fun to see just how many things you can do with Premiere. </p><p><br></p><p>3. LOWER THIRDS - You will always need a lower third when someone is talking on the screen. This lesson shows you how to place a lower thirds title in the right or lefthand side of the screen where the title of the talent is placed. Adobe offers .mogrt files that are already embedded into the program that you can dimply drag and drop into your sequence timeline.</p><p><br></p><p>4. TYPEWRITER EFFECT - If you're nostalgic,&nbsp; you'll remember the days of the typewriter. Still an occasional favorite.</p><p><br></p><p>5.&nbsp; ADD COLOR TO TITLES - Not just a color, but what about gradience and opacity? This lesson is more than just changing colors it gives you a dynamic look that is more than just one solid color with just a few clicks.</p><p><br></p><p>6. FADE AND BLUR - We always see titles fade in or out, but another creative way to make them unique is to blur them out. I use keyframes to start the gaussian blur effect and punch it up to gradually blur out the title completely. A great effect for your next feature film. </p><p><br></p><p>7. NEON SIGN - Back to glowing with a neon sign.&nbsp; Rounded like a lightbulb, this will emulate that neon sign in the store window that has a 3d tube-like bulb with a glowing filament inside.</p><p><br></p><p>8. KEY OUT LETTERS - Change it up with footage instead of a solid color. Adding a color key filter and replacing it with the video underneath is something additional you might think about in terms of giving one more layer of movement inside a static title.</p><p><br></p><p>9.&nbsp; GOOGLE SEARCH TITLE - Cropping from left to right, google had a commercial where people typed in the search bar. You can always to a screen record but if you ever want to use the cropping tool to move from left to right with keyframes, I can show you how to do that.</p><p><br></p><p>10. WRITE ON VIDEO</p><p>A cool way to circle around a title like using a pen or paintbrush to highlight a title is what you'll find in this lesson. </p><p><br></p><p>11. MAKE 3D TITLES - Place a title behind your talent and change the perspective and skew so it lines up with the layers on the brick wall.</p><p><br></p><p>12. END CREDITS ROLL - Your rolling credits at the end of a feature film. Starting from the bottom to the top, gently pull the titles off the screen for your starting point and have them scroll all the way off to the top. You can even adjust how fast you want them to scroll, or make them slow like a real feature film.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope you enjoy learning how to make your titles more unique in this 10 lesson one our course in Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p><br></p>";https://www.udemy.com/gift/how-to-make-cool-title-fx-in-premiere-pro/;Get creative with title effects in 12 mini lessons to engage your audience with dynamic titles for Adobe Premiere Pro.;3058;4.25;Beginner Level

Unfortunately this can often deter people when it comes to learning. To try and reduce this issue, we've made the majority of our videos fairly short (around 10-15 minutes long). This has been proven to have a greater impact in an educational setting, so naturally we have adopted it here. If you keep practicing regularly and dedicate a certain amount of time each day, you should be fine.

Native speakers will appreciate it if you can speak at least some of their language</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Suggested Learning Method:</strong></p><p>Despite this being an elementary level course, it is fairly intensive.

If you take any sentence from any Spanish book or any utterance, you will see that it fits into one of these structures.</p><p>I remember one weekend, I was writing some lessons for the week ahead, when I suddenly realised this. I noticed that there are a certain number of structures in Spanish, and that every sentence follows one of these structures. I spent the rest of the weekend working out all the structures, and I wrote them all down.</p><p>Every structure you learn gives you the ability to say a huge amount. Some structures are used more than others, but all the structures together make up the whole Spanish language. Once you’ve learnt how a structure works, all you have to do is insert different words into the slots and you have a sentence.</p><p>This course introduces you to structure 6. I’ve limited each course to one structure so as not to overburden you. By looking at just one structure at a time, you can really get to grips with it and understand its usage. It will help to clarify the Spanish language and make it more like a reflex rather than something you have to think about as is it were a maths equation.</p><p>Each structure can also help to propel you to fluency; if you can manipulate the structures at high speed, you can start to say anything you want without having to thing about how to say it.</p><p>This course contains plenty of practice opportunities for you to revise what you’ve learnt and it also contains some hints and tips on how best to learn and memorise the structures and the vocabulary that goes with them. You’ll learn how to make questions out of structure 6, how to make statements and how to turn positive statements negative.</p><p>The Building Structures in Spanish series is set out using the same learning techniques as the 3 Minute Spanish courses.
